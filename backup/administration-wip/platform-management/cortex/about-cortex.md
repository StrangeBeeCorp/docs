# About Cortex

TheHive uses Cortex to have access to analyzers and responsders.

1. Analyzers can be launched against observables to get more details about a given observable.
1. Responders can be launched against case, tasks, observables, logs, and alerts to execute an action.
1. One or more Cortex instances can be connected to TheHive.

You can connect your TheHive instance with many servers of cortex, and every server has its own configuration.
