# Rules for Organization

You can link an organization to other organizations. Linking an organization allows it to share a case and all its data with other organizations in order to work together on the same investigation. When you create an organization, you can define the default way of sharing tasks and observables. e.g., if an organization "XYZ" is linked with another organization "QPR" and if you want to share a case from organization "XYZ," the rules that can apply to the sharing of tasks and observables are manual, existingOnly, upcomingOnly, or all.

**Manual** - When you share a case with another organization, all the tasks and observables are not shared with the other organization by default. You have to share each task and observable manually.

**existingOnly** -  When you share a case with another organization, all the existing tasks and observables are shared with the other organization.

**upcomingOnly** - When you share a case with another organization, the existing tasks and observables won't be shared, but the upcoming ones will be shared automatically with the other organization.

**all** - All the existing an upcoming tasks and obervables are shared.
