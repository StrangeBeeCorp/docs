# About Case Status

By default, the TheHive application comes with a list of pre-defined case statuses. A case status describes the status of a case where the stage is New, InProgress, or Closed. You can customize the labels of the statuses.
e.g., You can customize the InProgress status as "Under Investigation" or "Pending Customer Reply" value, depending on your requirement.

You can see the list of all Case Statuses on the Entities Management page, in the Case Status tab.
