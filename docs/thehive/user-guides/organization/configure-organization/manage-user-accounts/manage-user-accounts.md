## Manage a user account email

Use this field when the login isnâ€™t an email address or when you want to set a different email. The email address is used to send notifications and password-related information to the user.

Update the email address and select **Confirm**.

## Edit a user account avatar

Select the avatar, then select a new image in PNG or JPG format. The file must be smaller than 500 KB. Select **Confirm** to apply the change.

## Check whether a user account has activated multi-factor authentication (MFA)

Move through the **MFA** section. If the user has activated multi-factor authentication, *Yes* appears.

## Edit a user account permission profile

Move through the **Organizations** section and update the [permission profile](../../../../administration/profiles/about-profiles.md) for the relevant organizations. Select **Confirm** to apply the change.

## Manage a user account API key

Move through the **API key** section and select **Renew**, **Reveal**, or **Revoke**, depending on the action you want to take. Select **Confirm** to apply the change.

## Delete a user account session

Move through the **Sessions** section and select **Delete** next to the session you want to delete. This logs the user out of the TheHive interface.

## Edit a user account password

The password edit feature is available only if an [SMTP server](../../../../administration/smtp/configure-smtp-server.md) is configured.

Move through the **Password** section and select **Edit password**. Select **Confirm** to apply the change. You must send the new password to the user via a secure channel.

## Reset a user account password

The password reset feature is available only if an [SMTP server](../../../../administration/smtp/configure-smtp-server.md) is configured.

Move through the **Password** section and select **Reset password**. The user gets an email asking them to choose a new password. The link is only valid for a limited time.
