# How to Configure the Microsoft Teams Notifier

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for configuring the Microsoft Teams [notifier](../about-notifications.md#notifiers) in TheHive.

!!! note "Notifier availability"
    The Microsoft Teams notifier is only available if the **Send notification to every user in the organization** toggle is turned off and the trigger is one of the following:  
    - *AnyEvent*  
    - *FilteredEvent*  
    - *ActionFinished*  
    - *CaseClosed*  
    - *CaseCreated*  
    - *CaseFlagged*  
    - *CaseShared*  
    - *AlertClosed*  
    - *AlertCreated*  
    - *AlertImported*  
    - *JobFinished*  
    - *AlertObservableCreated*  
    - *CaseObservableCreated*  
    - *ObservableCreated*  
    - *TaskClosed*  
    - *TaskMandatory*

## Procedure

### Step 1: Create a flow in the Workflows application

=== "If you are using TheHive 5.4.3 or later"

    1. Go to your Microsoft Teams application.

    2. Select :fontawesome-solid-ellipsis-h:.

      ![Microsoft select app](../../images/user-guides/organization/notifications/microsoft-teams.png)

    3. Select the **Workflows** application.

      ![Workflows app](../../images/user-guides/organization/notifications/workflows-app.png)

    4. In the **Workflows** application, select **New flow**.

    5. Search for a template named *Post to a channel when a webhook request is received*.

    6. Select the template **Post to a channel when a webhook request is received**.

    7. Enter your flow name.

    8. Select **Next**.

    9. Select a Microsoft Teams team and channel.

    10. Select **Create flow**.

    11. Copy the HTTP POST URL.

=== "If you are using TheHive 5.4.2 or earlier"

For TheHive versions earlier than 5.4.3, users can still send notifications to Microsoft Teams using Incoming Webhooks. This method simply requires creating a webhook and adding its URL to TheHiveâ€™s settings.

While easy to set up, this legacy approach lacks the customization and enhanced security features provided by the newer Workflows integration. Moreover, with Microsoft deprecating Incoming Webhooks, this method may become less reliable or lose functionality in the future.

!!! info "Migration expected by January 31, 2025"
    As announced by Microsoft on [their official blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/retirement-of-office-365-connectors-within-microsoft-teams/), Connector owners must update their webhook URLs by January 31, 2025, to comply with the new structure. This update is crucial for maintaining seamless integration and ensuring the continued functionality of Connectors in Microsoft Teams.

For detailed instructions, refer to Microsoft's official documentation on [creating an Incoming Webhook](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook?utm_source=chatgpt.com&tabs=newteams%2Cdotnet#create-an-incoming-webhook).

### Step 2: Create a Microsoft Teams endpoint

Refer to the [Add a Microsoft Teams endpoint](../../manage-endpoints/add-teams-endpoint.md) topic.

### Step 3: Configure the Microsoft Teams notifier

1. {!includes/organization-view-go-to.md!}

2. {!includes/notifications-tab-go-to.md!}

3. Select :fontawesome-solid-ellipsis-h: and then **Edit**.

4. Select the *Teams* notifier.

5. In the **Teams** drawer, enter the following information:

  **Endpoint**

  Using Microsoft Teams as a notifier requires at least one endpoint. This endpoint defines how TheHive connects to Microsoft Teams.

  Select [the endpoint you created]((../../manage-endpoints/add-teams-endpoint.md)).

  **Text template**

  The message content to be sent to the Microsoft Teams endpoint.

  If an [Adaptive Card](https://adaptivecards.io/) template is not provided, a plain text template is required. In version 5.4.3, plain text will automatically convert into an Adaptive Card format, which is structured using JSON.

  !!! tips "Tips to write text templates"
    
      #### Use the Adaptive Cards Designer
      Use [the Adaptive Cards Designer](https://adaptivecards.io/designer/) as a starting point to design your Adaptive Cards.
    
      #### Format dates
      * TheHive uses [Handlebars string helpers](https://github.com/jknack/handlebars.java/blob/master/handlebars/src/main/java/com/github/jknack/handlebars/helper/StringHelpers.java#L507-L543) to read dates.
      * Formatting date and time in notifications requires using dedicated [Java patterns](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html).

      #### Format other custom data from TheHive
      Few data custom to TheHive can be properly displayed using custom string handlers together with `object` data in notifications:
      * `tlpLabel` to display the TLP value (example: `{{tlpLabel object.tlp}}`)
      * `papLabel` to display the PAP value (example: `{{papLabel object.pap}}`)
      * `severityLabel` to display the severity value (example: `{{severityLabel object.severity}}`)
  
  Select **Add Variable** to dynamically insert values using available variables.

        },
        {
        "type": "TextBlock",
        "text": "{{object.description}}",
        "spacing": "None",
        "wrap": true,
        "horizontalAlignment": "Left",
        "maxLines": 3
        }
    ],
    "actions": [
        {
        "type": "Action.OpenUrl",
        "title": "Open Case in TheHive",
        "iconUrl": "https://docs.strangebee.com/images/thehive.png",
        "url": "{{url}}",
        "style": "positive"
        }
    ],
    "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
    "version": "1.5"
    }
    ```
  
  Used with the trigger *Case created*, this template will create a card like this in Microsoft Teams:
