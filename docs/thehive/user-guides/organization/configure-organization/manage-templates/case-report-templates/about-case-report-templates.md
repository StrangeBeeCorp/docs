# About Case Report Templates

<!-- md:license Platinum -->

Case report templates generate reports in a predefined format, available from case descriptions.

This topic provides an overview of case report templates and their usage in TheHive.

## Benefits

Use case reports to:

* Highlight key details for faster security actions
* Enhance better collaboration and decision-making
* Standardize reports for accurate analysis and comparisons
* Keep structured records for audits and regulations
* Build an archive for historical analysis and threat prevention

## Usage

[Create a case report template](create-a-case-report-template.md) to automatically generate reports in case descriptions.

## Structure

Every case report template includes a default header and footer section, which you can customize with content and case variables. You can't move or delete these sections, but they won't appear in the case report if left empty.

You can add [widgets](widgets-case-report-templates.md) between these sections to display case data. You can rearrange the order of widgets at any time.

## Permissions

{!includes/access-manage-case-report-templates.md!}

Once created, case report templates are automatically available to all users in your organization within case descriptions.
