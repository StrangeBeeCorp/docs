# About Case Report Templates

<!-- md:license Platinum -->

Case report templates generate [reports](../../../../analyst-corner/cases/case-reports/about-case-reports.md) in a predefined format, available from case descriptions.

This topic provides an overview of case report templates and their usage in TheHive.

## Benefits

Use case report templates to:

* Highlight key details for faster security actions
* Enhance better collaboration and decision-making
* Standardize reports for accurate analysis and comparisons
* Keep structured records for audits and regulations
* Build an archive for historical analysis and threat prevention

## Usage

[Create a case report template](create-a-case-report-template.md) to automatically generate reports in case descriptions.

## Structure

Every case report template includes default header and footer sections customizable with content and case variables. These sections can't be moved or deleted but remain hidden in the case report if left empty.

Add [widgets](widgets-case-report-templates.md) between these sections to display case data. The order of widgets can be rearranged at any time.

## Permissions

{!includes/access-manage-case-report-templates.md!}

Once created, case report templates are automatically available to all users in the organization within case descriptions.
