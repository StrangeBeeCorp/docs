# About Case Report Templates

Case report templates generate reports in a predefined format, accessible from case descriptions.

This topic provides an overview of case report templates and their usage in TheHive.

## Benefits

Use case reports to:

* Highlight key details for faster security actions
* Enhance better collaboration and decision-making
* Standardize reports for accurate analysis and comparisons
* Keep structured records for audits and regulations
* Build an archive for historical analysis and threat prevention

## Usage

[Create a case report template](create-a-case-report-template.md) to automatically generate reports in case descriptions.

## Structure

Every case report template includes a default header and footer section, which can be customized with content and case variables. While these sections cannot be moved or deleted, they will not appear in the case report if left empty.

You can add [widgets](about-widgets.md) between these sections to display case data. You can rearrange the order of widgets at any time.

## Permissions

{!includes/access-manage-case-report-templates.md!}
