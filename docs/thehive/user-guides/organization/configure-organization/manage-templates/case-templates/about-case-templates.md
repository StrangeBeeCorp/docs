# About Case Templates

Case templates streamline case creation in TheHive by automatically filling predefined fields.

This topic provides an overview of case template usage in TheHive.

## Benefits

Use case templates to:

* Simplify case creation workflows
* Save time when creating new cases
* Maintain consistency in case descriptions
* Enrich ongoing cases by adding additional information

## Usage

We recommend that you use a case template based on the threat category rather than the source. This approach helps you maximize the effectiveness of case templates by ensuring continuous improvement in their definition.

You can create a case from a case template when [initiating a new case](../../../../analyst-corner/cases/create-a-new-case.md).

You can also [apply a case template to an existing case](../../../../analyst-corner/cases/apply-a-case-template.md).

## Permissions

{!includes/access-manage-case-templates.md!}

Once created, case templates are automatically available to all users in your organization.

If you need to share a case template with another organization or TheHive instance, you can [export it](export-a-case-template.md) and [import it](import-a-case-template.md).
