# About Case Templates

Case templates streamline case creation in TheHive by automatically filling predefined fields.

This topic provides an overview of case template usage in TheHive.

## Benefits

Use case templates to:

* Simplify case creation workflows
* Save time when creating new cases
* Maintain consistency in case descriptions
* Enrich ongoing cases by adding additional information

## Usage

You can create a case from a case template when [initiating a new case](../../../analyst-corner/cases/create-a-new-case.md).

!!! info "Modifiable values"
    When creating a case from a template, users can modify prepopulated values as needed.

You can also [apply a case template to an existing case](../../../../analyst-corner/cases/apply-a-case-template.md).

## Permissions

{!includes/access-manage-case-templates.md!}

Once created, case templates are automatically available to all users in your organization.

If you need to share a case template with another organization, [export it from your current organization](export-a-case-template.md) and then [import it into the target organization](import-a-case-template.md).
