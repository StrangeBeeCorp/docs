# About Custom Tags

Custom tags are free texts manually added to cases, alerts, and observables in TheHive.

It's not possible to add a tag already present in a taxonomy, even if it is deactivated.

Custom tags can't be created outside of cases, alerts, and observables.

## Checks

No checks are done to standardize custom tags. Meaning that if two custom cases are written differently ,it will create two different custom cases.

## Managing custom cases

You can change the colors, rename custom cases and or delete a custom tags. You can see in how many cases, case templates, alerts, and observables a custom tag is tagged.

!!! Warning
    * Deleting a tag from this menu will remove the tag on every *Alert*, *Case* & O*bservables* in the organization.

## Scope

Custom tags are specific to a single organization and cant' be shared between organizations or TheHive instances. Users can define sensitive data in tags without worrying about any data leakage issue.
