# Hide Key Performance Indicators

<!-- md:version 5.4 --> <!-- md:permission `manageConfig` -->

By default, all key performance indicators (KPIs) appear in [case](../../../analyst-corner/cases/about-cases.md) and [alert](../../../analyst-corner/alerts/about-alerts.md) descriptions in TheHive.

You can hide some or all indicators if they're not useful or could be misleading for your organization.

If you want to know more about the KPIs available in TheHive, refer to [Key Performance Indicators](../../../key-performance-indicators/key-performance-indicators.md).
