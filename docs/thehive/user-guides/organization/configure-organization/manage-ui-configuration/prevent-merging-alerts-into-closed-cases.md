# Prevent Users from Merging Alerts into Closed Cases

<!-- md:permission `manageConfig` -->

By default, TheHive allows users to [merge alerts into closed cases](../../../analyst-corner/alerts/add-an-alert-to-an-existing-case.md).

You can deactivate this capability to prevent modifications to cases that have been completed.

A closed case is any case with a [status](../../../../administration/status/about-statuses.md) assigned to the *Closed* stage.

<h2>Procedure</h2>

1. {% include-markdown "includes/organization-view-go-to.md" %}

2. {% include-markdown "includes/ui-configuration-tab-go-to.md" %}

3. In the **Alert and case** section, turn on the **Merge alerts into closed cases** toggle.

4. Select **Confirm**.
