# About Alert Feeders

!!! note "Available from version 5.5"
    Alert feeders are available starting from version 5.5.

!!! warning "Platinum license required"
    A Platinum license is required to use alert feeders. If the license expires or becomes inactive, existing alert feeders will be automatically deactivated.

Alert feeders integrate external tools with TheHive without requiring them to push data. Instead, TheHive retrieves data from external systems on a scheduled basis.

The primary goal of alert feeders is to enhance TheHiveâ€™s ingestion capabilities while minimizing reliance on external services for data retrieval.

This topic provides an overview of the scope and usage of alert feeders in TheHive.

## How alert feeders work

Alert feeders allow your organization to automate data retrieval at a defined frequency from an external service through an HTTP API call. The retrieved data is then converted into alerts using [functions](../manage-functions/about-functions.md), which each alert feeder supporting only one function.

In addition to alerts, alert feeders can also generate cases and tasks.

### Alert feeder functions

You should not manually create an alert feeder function as a standalone function, as it cannot be linked to an alert feeder. Instead, [create it directly within the alert feeder](create-a-feeder.md). Once created, the function is automatically added to the [functions list](../manage-functions/about-functions.md) with the type *feeder*. 

You can then modify it either [from the functions list](../manage-functions/edit-a-function.md) or [the alert feeder configuration](edit-a-feeder.md).

When you delete an alert feeder, the associated function remains. To remove the function, follow the instructions in [Delete a Function](../manage-functions/delete-a-function.md).

## Usage

Any external system that exposes a public REST API supporting synchronous data retrieval can be integrated into TheHive using an alert feeder.

### Authentication modes

Currently, alert feeders support the following four authentication methods:

* None
* Basic
* Key
* Bearer

### Example integrations

Alert feeders can be used to integrate various external systems, including:

* Jira
* Airtable
* IBM Radar
* Rapid7
* SentinelOne

...and more!
