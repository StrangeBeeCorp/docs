## Call a Function

Once saved, the function can then be called with an http call from your system:

!!! Example ""

    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY' https://<thehive_url>/api/v1/function/<function_name> -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '
    {
        "eventId": "d9ec98b1-410f-40eb-8634-cfe189749da6",
        "date": "2021-06-05T12:45:36.698Z",
        "title": "An intrusion was detected",
        "details": "An intrusion was detected on the server 10.10.43.2",
        "data": [
            {"kind": "ip", "value": "10.10.43.2", "name": "server-ip" },
            {"kind": "name", "value": "root", "name": "login" },
            {"kind": "ip", "value": "92.43.123.1", "name": "origin" }
        ]
    }
    '
    ```

TheHive will take your input (the body of the http call), the definition of your function and execute the function with the input.
It will respond to the HTTP call with the data returned by the function.
