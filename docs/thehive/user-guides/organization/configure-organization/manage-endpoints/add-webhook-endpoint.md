2. {!includes/endpoints-tab-go-to.md!}

    ---

3. Select :fontawesome-solid-plus: or **Add a new endpoint**.

    ---

4. In the **Endpoint creation** drawer, select *Webhook*.

    ---

5. Enter the following information:

    **- Name**

    The endpoint name, used to identify this webhook integration in TheHive. This name must be unique, as two endpoints can't have the same name.

    **- URL**

    The URL to which TheHive will send webhook requests.

    **- Version**

    Enter the webhook version supported by your external system. This determines the payload format and request structure that TheHive will use when sending data.

8. Add a certificate authority.

    For more information about configuring SSL, refer to the [Configure SSL](../../../../administration/authentication/ssl.md) topic.

    Use certificates only from trusted, predefined authorities for secure connections. Custom certificate authorities are not allowed.

    You can turn off the **Don't check certificate authority** toggle to bypass certificate validation, but this isn't recommended as it may compromise connection security.
