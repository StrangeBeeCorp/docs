# About Key Performance Indicators

Starting from version 5.1, TheHive provides valuable insights into event and incident time metrics, enabling you to track key performance indicators (KPIs) for [cases](../analyst-corner/cases/about-cases.md) and [alerts](../analyst-corner/alerts/about-alerts.md).

These KPIs are displayed by default on all cases and alerts in TheHive. You can also integrate them into dashboards and case reports.

This topic defines each of these indicators.

## Time to detect (TTD)

The time it takes to create a case or alert in TheHive after the event occurs. This metric helps assess the effectiveness of your monitoring tools and detection capabilities.

## Time to triage (TTT)

The time it takes for your security team to acknowledge a case or alert by changing its status to *In Progress* after its creation in TheHive. It reflects how efficiently alerts and cases are reviewed and escalated for investigation.

## Time to acknowledge (TTA)

The time it takes for your security team to acknowledge a case or alert by changing its status to *In Progress* after the event occurs. This measures the responsiveness of your team after detecting a potential security incident.

## Time to qualify (TTQ)

The time it takes for your security team to analyze an alert and determine whether it is a true positive or false positive, resulting in case closure or merging into a case. This metric helps measure the accuracy and speed of the qualification process.

## Time to resolve (TTR)

The time it takes for your security team to fully resolve an incident after it has been marked *In Progress*. This includes investigation, remediation, and closure, indicating the efficiency of your incident response process.
