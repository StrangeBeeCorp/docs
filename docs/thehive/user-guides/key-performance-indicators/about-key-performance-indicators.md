# About Key Performance Indicators

Starting from version 5.1, TheHive provides valuable insights into event and incident time metrics, enabling you to track key performance indicators for [cases](../analyst-corner/cases/about-cases.md) and [alerts](../analyst-corner/alerts/about-alerts.md).

This topic defines each of these indicators.

## Time to detect - TDD

The time it takes for your security team to detect abnormal activity that may indicate malicious, suspicious, or risky behavior in your environment. This metric helps assess the effectiveness of your monitoring tools and detection capabilities.

## Time to triage - TTT

The time it takes for your security team to assess and prioritize a detected alert, determining its relevance, severity, and required response. It reflects how efficiently alerts are reviewed and escalated for investigation.

## Time to qualify - TTQ 

The time it takes for your security team to analyze an alert and determine its validityâ€”whether it is a true positive, a false positive, or requires further investigation. This metric helps measure the accuracy and speed of the qualification process.

## Time to acknowledge - TTA

The time it takes for your security team to acknowledge an event by transitioning its status to *In Progress*. This measures the responsiveness of your team after detecting a potential security incident.

## Time to resolve - TTR

The time it takes to fully resolve an incident after it has been marked *In Progress*. This includes investigation, remediation, and closure, indicating the efficiency of your incident response process.

For more information on these indicators, we recommend you consult this [SecurityScorecard blog post](https://securityscorecard.com/blog/kpis-for-security-operations-incident-response/).
