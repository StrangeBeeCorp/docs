# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Starting from **version 5.1**, **TheHive** provides valuable insights into event and incident time metrics, allowing you to track **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** for both [cases](../analyst-corner/cases/about-cases.md) and [alerts](../analyst-corner/alerts/about-alerts.md).

These KPIs are displayed by default on all cases and alerts within **TheHive**. Additionally, they can be integrated into dashboards and case reports to enhance monitoring and analysis.

This section defines each KPI and its significance in security operations.

## Time to Detect (TTD)

**Definition:**  
The duration taken by your security team to detect abnormal activity that may indicate **malicious, suspicious, or risky behavior** within your environment.

**Purpose:**  
This metric evaluates the effectiveness of your **monitoring tools** and **detection capabilities**, helping to assess how quickly threats are identified.

## Time to Triage (TTT)

**Definition:**  
The time required for your security team to **assess and prioritize a detected alert**, determining its **relevance, severity, and required response**.

**Purpose:**  
It reflects how efficiently alerts are reviewed and escalated for investigation, ensuring that critical threats are addressed promptly.

## Time to Acknowledge (TTA)

**Definition:**  
The time taken for your security team to **acknowledge an event** by transitioning its status to **In Progress**.

**Purpose:**  
This metric measures your team's **responsiveness** after detecting a potential security incident, indicating how quickly they react to new alerts.

## Time to Qualify (TTQ)

**Definition:**  
The duration needed for your security team to **analyze an alert** and determine whether it is a **true positive, false positive, or requires further investigation**.

**Purpose:**  
This helps measure the **accuracy and speed** of the qualification process, ensuring that resources are focused on genuine threats.

## Time to Resolve (TTR)

**Definition:**  
The time required to **fully resolve an incident** after it has been marked as **In Progress**. This includes **investigation, remediation, and closure**.

**Purpose:**  
This metric assesses the **efficiency** of your incident response process by tracking how long it takes to remediate and close security incidents.
