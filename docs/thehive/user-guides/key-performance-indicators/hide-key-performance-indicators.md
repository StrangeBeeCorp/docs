# How to Hide Key Performance Indicators

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for hiding one or several key performance indicators for [cases](../analyst-corner/cases/about-cases.md) and [alerts](../analyst-corner/alerts/about-alerts.md) in TheHive.

By default, all indicators are displayed in case and alert descriptions. Since version 5.4, you can hide some or all indicators if they are not useful or could be misleading for your organization.

If you want to know more about the key performance indicators available in TheHive, refer to the [About Key Performance Indicators](about-key-performance-indicators.md) topic.
