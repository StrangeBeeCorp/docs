# Hiding Key Performance Indicators

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for hiding one or more **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** for [cases](../analyst-corner/cases/about-cases.md) and [alerts](../analyst-corner/alerts/about-alerts.md) in **TheHive**.

By default, all KPIs are displayed in case and alert descriptions. However, starting from **version 5.4**, you can hide specific indicators if they are **not relevant** or **could be misleading** for your organization.

For a detailed overview of KPIs in **TheHive**, refer to [About Key Performance Indicators](about-key-performance-indicators.md).

!!! warning "Required Permissions"
    Only users with an **admin-type profile** that has the **`manageConfig`** permission can hide KPIs in case and alert descriptions.
