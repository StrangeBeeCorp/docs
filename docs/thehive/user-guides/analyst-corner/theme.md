# Choosing Your Theme in TheHive

Starting from version 5.4.0, TheHive allows you to customize the application's appearance by selecting between Light, Dark, or System themes. This feature enhances user experience by accommodating personal preferences and varying lighting conditions.

## Theme Options

- **Light Theme**: Ideal for well-lit environments, the Light theme uses brighter colors and lighter backgrounds to enhance readability and reduce glare.
- **Dark Theme**: Suitable for low-light conditions, the Dark theme employs darker colors and backgrounds to reduce eye strain during nighttime or in dimly lit rooms.
- **System Theme**: This option allows TheHive to follow your operating system's theme settings. If your system automatically switches between light and dark modes based on the time of day or other factors, TheHive will adapt accordingly.
