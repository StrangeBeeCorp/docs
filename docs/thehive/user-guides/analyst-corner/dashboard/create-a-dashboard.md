# How to Create a Dashboard

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for creating a [dashboard](about-dashboards.md) in TheHive.

You can create a dashboard from scratch or duplicate an existing one.

If you want to use a dashboard from another organization or TheHive instance as a template, you can [import it](import-a-dashboard.md).
