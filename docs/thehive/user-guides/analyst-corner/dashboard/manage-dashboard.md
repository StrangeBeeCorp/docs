# Managing Dashboards

Dashboards in TheHive provide a convenient way to visualize and track data relevant to investigations, alerts, and ongoing cases. By organizing widgets, charts, and metrics on a single screen, you can quickly gain insights and monitor your security operations in real time.

> **New in Version 5.4.0**  
> A new permission, **Manage Dashboard**, has been introduced to control the ability to modify dashboards.  
> - If a user **has** the **Manage Dashboard** permission, they can create, edit, import, duplicate, and delete dashboards.  
> - If a user **does not have** the **Manage Dashboard** permission (including read-only profiles), they can only view dashboards without making any modifications.

## Understanding Dashboard Visibility

When creating or editing dashboards, you can set the **Visibility** to either **Private** or **Shared**:

- **Private**: Only the dashboard creator (you) can view and modify it.  
- **Shared**: Other users in TheHive can view the dashboard. However, only users with the **Manage Dashboard** permission can modify it.

2. Enter the **Title**.  

    Provide a clear, descriptive name (e.g., *SOC Overview*, *Incident Response Stats*) to help identify the dashboardâ€™s purpose.

3. Enter the **Description**.  
   
    Summarize the intent or scope of the dashboard (e.g., *Displays key metrics on ongoing alerts*).

4. Select the **Visibility** option (Private or Shared).  

5. Click the **Confirm** button.

## Uploading a Dashboard

    ![Import dashboard](/thehive/images/user-guides/analyst-corner/dashboard/import-dashboard.png)

> **Tip:** Keep backups of your dashboard JSON files in a secure location. This helps you quickly restore or duplicate dashboards when needed.

## Downloading a Dashboard

To export a dashboard (no special permission is needed to **view** or **export** dashboards; however, only users with the **Manage Dashboard** permission can create or modify them):

1. Click the **Export** option. 

2. A JSON file is downloaded, which can be shared or imported into another instance of TheHive.

    ![Export dashboard menu](/thehive/images/user-guides/analyst-corner/dashboard/export-dashboard-menu.png)

> **Tip:** Regularly exporting and archiving key dashboards allows you to maintain versions and share best practices among team members.

## Cloning a Dashboard

> **Note:** This action requires the **Manage Dashboard** permission.

Duplicating a dashboard lets you create a new one with the same widgets and layout:

1. From the dashboard list, select **Duplicate**.  
2. A new window opens, pre-filled with the original dashboard's configuration.  
3. Modify the **Title**, **Description**, and **Visibility** if needed.  
4. Click **Confirm** to create the duplicated dashboard.

> **Best Practice:** When duplicating a dashboard, update its name to avoid confusion (e.g., *SOC Overview - APAC*).

## Summary of Permission Requirements

- **Manage Dashboard** Permission (introduced in 5.4.0):  
  - Create new dashboards  
  - Edit existing dashboards  
  - Import dashboards  
  - Duplicate dashboards  
  - Delete dashboards

- **No Manage Dashboard** Permission (read-only profiles):  
  - Can only access (view) dashboards in read-only mode
