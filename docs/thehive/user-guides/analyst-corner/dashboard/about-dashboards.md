# About Dashboards

A dashboard compiles and visualizes data to provide key insights at a glance.

This topic describes dashboards in the context of TheHive, including their functionality.

!!! note "Specific case reporting"
    To access reporting data for a specific case, use the [case report](../cases/cases-description/case-reports/about-case-reports.md) and [case timeline](../cases/cases-description/case-timelines/about-case-timeline.md) features.

## Configuration

Dashboards consist of [widgets](widgets-dashboards.md) that you can drag into place.

TheHive includes four default dashboards: 

* Alerts statistics
* Cases statistics
* Observables statistics
* TTPs statistics

You can [customize these default dashboards](edit-a-dashboard.md) and [create new ones from scratch](create-a-dashboard.md).

## Scope

Dashboards exist at the organization level and cannot be shared across organizations.

However, you can manually share dashboards between organizations or TheHive instances by [exporting](export-a-dashboard.md) and [importing](import-a-dashboard.md) them. These dashboards will remain independent and unlinked. This can be useful if you want to use a template instead of starting from scratch.

## Visibility

Dashboards can be private or shared with the entire organization.

Only the dashboard owner can [change its visibility](change-visibility-of-a-dashboard.md):

* For shared dashboards, the default owner is the creator.
* For private dashboards, the owner is the creator.

## Group

Dashboards are grouped to improve visibility and usability.

## Permissions

{!includes/access-manage-dashboards.md!}

Every user has read access to the dashboards within their organization and can export dashboards.
