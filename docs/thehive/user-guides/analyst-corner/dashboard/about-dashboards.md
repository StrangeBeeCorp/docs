# About Dashboards

A dashboard compiles and visualizes data to provide key insights at a glance.

This topic describes dashboards in the context of TheHive, including their functionality.

## 


The dashboard is configurable, allowing you to choose which data you want to see and whether you want to include charts or graphs to visualize the numbers.

The dashboard lists all details of cases such as, status, name, version number, widget, created by, dates of creation and date on which data was updated. A user can apply filters on the dashboard, sort based on fields, and manage views.

# Dashboards and Reporting

TheHive comes with a reporting module that allows designing shared and private dashbords using various widgets for data visualisation. Reports can gather metrics from any data stored in TheHive like cases, alerts, tasks, observables...

## Dashboards

Every user has read access to the dashboards defined in the organization (s)he belongs to. If the `manageDashboard` permission is part of the user's profile, the user can create dashboards.
