# About Views

Views save [filters and sorting](../about-filtering-and-sorting.md) applied to a list in TheHive.

This topic explains how views function in TheHive.

## Default view

A *Default* view without filters or sorting is always available. Modifying or deleting this view isn't permitted.

## Actions

Users have the ability to [create custom views](create-a-custom-view.md) tailored to their specific needs or [update existing views](update-a-custom-view.md) as necessary. When a view is no longer useful, it can be [deleted](delete-a-custom-view.md) to keep the workspace organized.

To switch between different views, users select the current view in the top-left corner of the screen.

## Scope

Views are user-specific and list-specific, meaning each user has access to their own saved views, which apply only to a specific list.

## Behavior

The last used view is automatically applied by default when accessing a list.
