# About Views

Views save [filters and sorting](../about-filtering-and-sorting.md) applied to a list in TheHive.

This topic explains how views function in TheHive.

!!! info "Beta feature available for filters and views"
    <!-- md:version 5.5.6 --> A beta feature to enhance user experience for filters and views is available for testing on lists of cases, alerts, tasks, and observables. For detailed instructions on how to activate this beta feature, see [Activate the Beta of Filters and Views](../../../user-guides/manage-user-settings.md#activate-the-beta-of-filters-and-views).

## Default view

A *Default* view without filters or sorting is always available. Modifying or deleting this view isn't permitted.

## Actions

Users have the ability to [create custom views](create-a-custom-view.md) tailored to their specific needs or [update existing views](update-a-custom-view.md) as necessary. When a view is no longer useful, it can be [deleted](delete-a-custom-view.md) to keep the workspace organized.

To switch between different views, users select the current view in the top-left corner of the screen.

## Scope

Views are user-specific and list-specific, meaning each user has access to their own saved views, which apply only to a specific list.

## Behavior

The last used view is automatically applied by default when accessing a list.
