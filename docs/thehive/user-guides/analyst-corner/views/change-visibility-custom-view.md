# Change a Custom View Visibility

<!-- md:version 5.6 -->

Change the visibility of your custom [views](about-views.md) in TheHive to control who can access and modify them within your organization.

## Share a custom view with the entire organization

When you share a private view with your organization, all users gain immediate access to it. They can use, modify, and delete the shared view.
