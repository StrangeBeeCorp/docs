{!includes/access-manage-tasks.md!}

<h2>Procedure</h2>

1. [Find the case](../cases/search-for-cases/find-a-case.md) where you want to add a task.

2. {!includes/tasks-tab-go-to.md!}

3. Select :fontawesome-solid-plus:.

4. Enter the following information:

    **- Group \***

    The group the task belongs to. Groups help organize and visualize tasks.

    **- Title \***

    The title of the task.

    **- Mandatory \***

    Whether the task is mandatory. Mandatory tasks must have at least one [task log](about-task-logs.md) before they can be marked as *Completed*, and the case can't be closed until all mandatory tasks are completed.

    **- Description**

    A description of the task using [TheHive-flavored Markdown syntax](../../thehive-flavored-markdown.md). It appears only in the task preview.

    **- Assignee**

    The person assigned to the task.

    **- Flag this task? \***

    Whether to flag the task to highlight it for all users in your organization. Flagged tasks are more visible in the task list.

    **- Due date**

    The date by which the task should be completed.

5. Select **Confirm**.
