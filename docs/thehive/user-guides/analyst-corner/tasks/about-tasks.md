# About Tasks

This topic explains tasks, their components, and how to create them in TheHive.

## Definition

A task is an action that needs to be completed within a case.

Tasks can be mandatory or optional and are organized into groups.

## Sources

Tasks can be created manually or automatically through [alert feeders](../../organization/configure-organization/manage-feeders/about-feeders.md).

## Key components

A task includes [task logs](../tasks/preview-task-details/create-a-task-log.md), also referred to as activities.

## Behavior

* Tasks are automatically closed when you close a case, even if some non-mandatory tasks remain incomplete or unassigned.

* You can flag or pin tasks o make them easier to identify:
    * Flag a task to highlight it for all users in your organization.
    * Pin a task to keep it easily accessible for yourself.
