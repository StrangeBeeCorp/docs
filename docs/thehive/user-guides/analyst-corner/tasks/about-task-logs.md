# About Task Logs

This topic explains what task logs are and how they're used in TheHive.

## Definition

A task log is where analysts record their actions, observations, and decisions in response to a [task](about-tasks.md).

In TheHive, a task log is also referred to as an activity.

## Sources

Analysts should create a task log whenever they perform or complete a meaningful action, observation, or decision related to the task. Certain task logs can be automated, but analytical insights and contextual observations typically require manual input.

## Examples

Tasks logs can include actions such as:

* Investigating authentication, VPN, or endpoint activity
* Reviewing system or script execution logs
* Identifying signs of lateral movement or account compromise
* Running targeted scans for potential exposures

* Applying network or system-level containment measures

* Providing awareness or policy guidance to employees
* Implementing or reinforcing data protection policies

* Tuning detection rules for improved accuracy
* Updating workflows or processes based on incident findings

* Documenting insights or lessons learned

## Format

Task logs can include text using [TheHive-flavored Markdown syntax](../../thehive-flavored-markdown.md) or images.
