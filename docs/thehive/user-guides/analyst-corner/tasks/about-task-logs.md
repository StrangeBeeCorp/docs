# About Task Logs

This topic explains what task logs are and how they are used in TheHive.

## Definition

A task log is a record of actions, observations, or decisions made while working on a specific [task](about-tasks.md). Task logs help ensure traceability, support team collaboration, and provide a clear audit trail for compliance and post-incident reviews.

In TheHive, a task log is also referred to as an activity.

## Sources

Task logs must be created manually. Users should create a task log whenever they perform or complete a meaningful action related to the task.

This includes steps like:

* Collecting evidence
* Reaching out to stakeholders
* Updating a system
* Documenting conclusions
