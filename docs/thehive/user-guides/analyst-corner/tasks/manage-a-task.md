{% include-markdown "includes/access-manage-tasks.md" %}

## Set a task as mandatory or optional

1. [Find the task](../tasks/search-for-tasks/find-a-task.md) you want to update.

2. In the task details, turn the **Mandatory** toggle on or off.

    Mandatory tasks must contain at least one [task log](about-task-logs.md) before you can mark them as *Completed*. You can't close a case until all mandatory tasks are completed.

3. Select **Confirm**.

## Change the task assignee

1. [Find the task](../tasks/search-for-tasks/find-a-task.md) you want to update.

2. In the task details, select a new assignee.

3. Select **Confirm**.

## Pin a task

Pinning a task allows you to access it from the **Tasks** tab within a case. Pins are personal and only visible to you.

1. [Find the task](../tasks/search-for-tasks/find-a-task.md) you want to pin.

2. In the task details, select :fontawesome-solid-thumbtack:.

## Flag a task

Flagging a task highlights it for all users in your organization, making it more visible in the task list.

1. [Find the task](../tasks/search-for-tasks/find-a-task.md) you want to flag.

2. In the task details, select :fontawesome-solid-ellipsis:.

3. Select **Flag**.
