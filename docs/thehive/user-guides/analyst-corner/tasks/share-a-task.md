[Manually share a task in a shared case](../../../administration/organizations/about-organizations-sharing-rules.md#manual-sharing-of-tasks-and-observables-in-a-shared-case) with [linked organizations](../../../administration/organizations/link-an-organization.md) in TheHive.

!!! info "Shared cases only"
    To share a task manually, the case must already be shared with the relevant linked organizations. If not, refer to [Share a Case](../cases/share-a-case.md).

This is useful when task sharing rules are set to *manual*, ensuring that users share only the relevant tasks.

To learn more about how sharing rules function and interact, see [About Organizations Sharing Rules](../../../administration/organizations/about-organizations-sharing-rules.md).
