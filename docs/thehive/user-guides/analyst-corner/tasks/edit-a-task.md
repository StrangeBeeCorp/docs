# How to Edit a Task

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for editing a [task](about-tasks.md) in TheHive.

{!includes/access-manage-tasks.md!}

<h2>Procedure</h2>

1. [Find the task](../tasks/search-for-tasks/find-a-task.md) you want to update.

2. Enter the following information:

    **- Group \***

    The group the task belongs to. Groups help organize and visualize tasks.

    **- Title \***

    The title of the task.

    **- Mandatory \***

    Whether the task is mandatory. Mandatory tasks must contain at least one [task log](about-task-logs.md) before you can mark them as *Completed*. You can't close a case until all mandatory tasks are completed.

    **- Description**

    A description of the task using [TheHive-flavored Markdown syntax](../../thehive-flavored-markdown.md). It appears only in the task preview.

    **- Assignee**

    The person assigned to the task.

    **- Flag this task? \***

    Whether to flag the task to highlight it for all users in your organization. Flagged tasks are more visible in the task list.

    **- Due date**

    The date by which the task should be completed.

3. Select **Confirm**.
