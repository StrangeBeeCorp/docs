# How to Edit a Task Log

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for editing a [task log](about-task-logs.md) in TheHive.

<h2>Procedure</h2>

1. [Locate the task log](../tasks/search-for-tasks/find-a-task-log.md) you want to edit.

2. {!includes/activity-section-go-to.md!}

3. Select :fontawesome-solid-ellipsis: next the task log.

4. Select **Edit**.

5. In the **Edit a task log** drawer, enter the text you want to add in the **Log** field using [TheHive-flavored Markdown syntax](../../thehive-flavored-markdown.md).

6. Optional: Add images to the task log.

    * To add an image as an attachment, drop it into the **Attachment** section or select it from your computer.

    * <!-- md:version 5.5 --> To display an image at full size in the **Activity** feed, drop it into the **Log** field or use the :fontawesome-solid-image: symbol.

    !!! tip "Wait for the upload to complete"
        Wait until the image path appears in parentheses in the log field. If it doesn’t, the image hasn’t finished uploading and won’t display as expected.
