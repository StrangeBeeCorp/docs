# How to Find a Task

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for using various methods to search for a [task](../about-tasks.md) in TheHive.

If youâ€™re unsure which method to use, refer to the [Overview of Search Methods for Tasks](overview-search-methods-task.md) topic.

!!! tip "Can't find a task?"
    Since TheHive 5.5, [case visibility](../../cases/about-cases.md#case-visibility) can be restricted to protect sensitive data. If you aren't an authorized user, its linked tasks won't appear in the list, search results, or dashboards.

## Method 1: Tasks tab in cases descriptions

*Use this method if you want to find one or more tasks related to a case and want to perform actions on them simultaneously.*

1. Open a case and select the **Tasks** tab.

## Method 2: Filters in the Tasks view

*Use this method if you need to search for one or more tasks without requiring simultaneous actions.*

1. Go to the **Tasks** view from the sidebar menu.
