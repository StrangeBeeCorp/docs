# How to Find a Task Log

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for searching a task log in TheHive.

A task log is a recorded history of actions, updates, or decisions taken on a specific task. It provides a detailed audit trail that helps track investigation progress, accountability, and compliance.

!!! tip "Why can't I find a task log?"
    Since TheHive 5.5, [case visibility](../../cases/about-cases.md#case-visibility) can be restricted to protect sensitive data. If you aren't an authorized user, its linked tasks and task logs won't appear in the list, search results, or dashboards.

<h2>Procedure</h2>

1. Go to the **Global Search** view from the sidebar menu.
