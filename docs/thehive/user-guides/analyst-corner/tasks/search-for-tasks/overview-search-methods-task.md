# Overview of Search Methods for Tasks

TheHive offers multiple methods for searching [tasks](../about-tasks.md), each tailored to specific scenarios.

## Search method comparison

| Method | Filter options | Allows bulk actions | Use case |
| -------| ------------------| --------------------| ---------|
| [Search bar](find-a-task.md#method-1-search-bar) | None | No | If you need to conduct simple searches for one or more tasks without requiring simultaneous actions. |
| [Tasks tab in cases descriptions](find-a-task.md#method-2-tasks-tab-in-cases-descriptions) | Multiple | Yes | If you want to find one or more tasks related to a case and want to perform actions on them simultaneously. |
| [Filters in the Tasks view](find-a-task.md#method-3-filters-in-the-tasks-view) | Multiple | No | If you need to search for one or more tasks without requiring simultaneous actions. |
| [Global Search feature](find-a-task.md#method-4-global-search-feature) | Advanced | No | If you need to conduct advanced searches for one or more tasks without requiring simultaneous actions. |
