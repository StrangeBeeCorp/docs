# Create a Task Log

<!-- md:permission `manageTask` -->

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for creating a [task log](about-task-logs.md) in TheHive.

A task log—also referred to as an activity—is where analysts record their actions, observations, and decisions in response to a [task](about-tasks.md). Task logs can be recorded at any time, regardless of the task’s status, including when it's marked as *Completed*.

<h2>Procedure</h2>

1. [Locate the task](../tasks/search-for-tasks/find-a-task.md) where you want to create a task log.

2. {% include-markdown "includes/activity-section-go-to.md" %}

3. Select :fontawesome-solid-plus:.

4. In the **Create a task log** drawer, enter the text you want to add in the **Log** field using [TheHive-flavored Markdown syntax](../../thehive-flavored-markdown.md).

    {% include-markdown "includes/task-logs-no-observables.md" %}

5. Optional: Add images to the task log.

    * To add an image as an attachment, drop it into the **Attachment** section or select it from your computer.

    * <!-- md:version 5.5 --> To display an image at full size in the **Activity** feed, drop it into the **Log** field or use the :fontawesome-solid-image: symbol.

    !!! warning "Wait for the upload to complete"
        Wait until the image path appears in parentheses. If it doesn’t, the upload is still in progress, and the image won’t display as expected.

6. Select **Confirm**.
