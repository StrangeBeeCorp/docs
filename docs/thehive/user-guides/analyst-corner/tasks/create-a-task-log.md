5. Optional: Add images to the task log.

    * To add an image as an attachment, drop it into the **Attachment** section or select it from your computer.

    * <!-- md:version 5.5 --> To display an image at full size in the **Activity** feed, drop it into the **Log** field or use the :fontawesome-solid-image: symbol.

    !!! warning "Wait for the upload to complete"
        Wait until the image path appears in parentheses. If it doesn’t, the upload is still in progress, and the image won’t display as expected.
