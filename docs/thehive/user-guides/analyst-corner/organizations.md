# About Organization

Organizations are the customers or tenants who are using the TheHive application.

TheHive comes with a default organisation named "admin" and is dedicated to users with administrator permissions of TheHive instance. This organisation is very specific so that it can manage global objects and cannot contain cases or any other related elements.

By default, organisations canâ€™t see each other and can't share data. 

On the home page, you can see the organisation List.
