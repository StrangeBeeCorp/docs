# About Tactics, Techniques and Procedures

Tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) describe the behaviors and methods commonly used by specific threat actors or groups.

## Definitions

Tactics describe the goals of threat actorsâ€”what they're trying to achieve.

Techniques show how they achieve those goals.

Procedures detail how they implement the techniques in practice.

## MITRE ATT&CK framework

By default, TheHive includes the [MITRE Enterprise Matrix](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/). It's installed during setup, and a catalog named Enterprise Attack is created with all the techniques.

[This catalog can be updated](../../../../administration/ttps/update-a-catalog.md) or supplemented by [adding others](../../../../administration/ttps/add-a-catalog.md).

## Actions

[Add](add-ttps.md) or [remove](remove-ttps.md) TTPs from cases. You can also [export](export-ttps.md) TTPs from both cases and alerts.

## Permissions

Only users with an admin-type profile that has the `managePattern` permission can manage TTPs in TheHive.

Only users with the `manageProcedure` permission can add and remove TTPs in cases and alerts in TheHive.
