# About Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)

Tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) describe the behaviors and methods commonly used by specific threat actors or groups.

This topic provides a general overview of TTPs usage in TheHive.

## Definitions

Tactics describe the goals of threat actorsâ€”what they are trying to achieve.

Techniques explain how those goals are accomplished.

Procedures are the specific implementations of techniques.

## MITRE ATT&CK framework

By default, TheHive includes the [MITRE Enterprise Matrix](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/). It's installed during setup, and a catalog named Enterprise Attack is created with all the techniques.

You can [update this catalog](../../../../administration/ttps/update-a-catalog.md) or [add others](../../../../administration/ttps/add-a-catalog.md).

## Actions

In TheHive, you can [add TTPs](add-ttps.md) to both alerts and cases.
