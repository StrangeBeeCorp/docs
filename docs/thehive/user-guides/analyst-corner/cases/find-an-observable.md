# How to Find an Observable

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for using various methods to search for an observable in TheHive.

## Method 1: Observables tab

*Use this method if you know the case or alert containing the observable you're looking for or if you need to perform actions on multiple observables simultaneously.*

1. Open a case or an alert, and select the **Observables** tab.

## Method 2: Global Search feature

*Use this method if you’re unsure where to find the observable you’re looking for or if you need to conduct advanced searches for multiple observables without requiring simultaneous actions.*

1. Go to the **Global Search** view from the sidebar menu.

        Select the **All elements** item for a comprehensive tool-wide overview that encompasses all entity types (cases, alerts, observables, jobs, tasks, and task logs), to analyze cross-linked information, or to conduct a detailed investigation.
