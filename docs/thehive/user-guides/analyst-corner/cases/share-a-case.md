# How to Share a Case

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for configuring [local sharing rules](../../../administration/organizations/about-organizations-sharing-rules.md#local-sharing-rules) with [linked organizations](../../../administration/organizations/link-an-organization.md) for a specific case in TheHive.

!!! info "Global sharing rules"
This guide focuses on local sharing rules for individual cases. To configure global sharing rules for all cases in your organization, refer to [How to Link an Organization](../../../administration/organizations/link-an-organization.md).

To learn more about how sharing rules function and interact, refer to [About Organizations Sharing Rules](../../../administration/organizations/about-organizations-sharing-rules.md).
