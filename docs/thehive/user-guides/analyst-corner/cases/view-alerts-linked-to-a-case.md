# View Alerts Linked to a Case

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for viewing alerts linked to a [case](../cases/about-cases.md) in TheHive.

An alert is automatically linked to a case when you [create a case from an alert](../alerts/create-a-case-from-an-alert.md) or [add an alert to an existing case](../alerts/add-an-alert-to-an-existing-case.md).

<h2>Procedure</h2>

1. [Find the case](./search-for-cases/find-a-case.md) where you want to view linked alerts.

2. {% include-markdown "includes/linked-alerts-tab-go-to.md" %}

    {% include-markdown "includes/filters-sorts-views.md" %}

<h2>Next steps</h2>

* [Unlink an Alert and a Case](../alerts/unlink-alert-case.md)
