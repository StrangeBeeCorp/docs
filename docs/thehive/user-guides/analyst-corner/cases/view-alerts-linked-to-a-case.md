# How to View Alerts Linked to a Case

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for viewing alerts linked to a [case](../cases/about-cases.md) in TheHive.

An alert is automatically linked to a case when you [import it into a new case](../create-a-new-case.md#create-a-case-from-an-alert) or [merge it into an existing one](../../alerts/merge-an-alert-into-an-existing-case.md).

<h2>Procedure</h2>

1. [Find the case](./search-for-cases/find-a-case.md) where you want to view linked alerts.

2. {!includes/linked-alerts-tab-go-to.md!}
