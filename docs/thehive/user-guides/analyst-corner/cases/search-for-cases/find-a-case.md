# How to Find a Case

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for using various methods to search for a [case](../about-cases.md) in TheHive.

If youâ€™re unsure which method to use, refer to the [Overview of Search Methods for Cases](overview-search-methods-case.md) topic.

!!! tip "Why can't I find a case?"
    Since TheHive 5.5, [case visibility](../../cases/about-cases.md#case-visibility) can be restricted to protect sensitive data. If you aren't an authorized user, it won't appear in the case list, search results, or dashboards.

## Method 1: Enter a case number search box

*Use this method if you already know the case number you're looking for.*

1. Enter the case number in the search box located at the top of the page, visible across all views.

2. Press **Enter** or select :material-magnify:.

3. The case description appears.

## Method 2: Similar cases

*Use this method if you want to find one or more cases similar to a known case without needing to perform actions on them simultaneously.*

1. Open a case, an alert, or a task, and select the **Similar cases** tab.

## Method 3: Filters in the Cases view
