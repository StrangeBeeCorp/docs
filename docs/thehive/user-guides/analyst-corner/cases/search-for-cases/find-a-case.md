# How to Find a Case

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for using various methods to search for a [case](../about-a-case.md) in TheHive.

If youâ€™re unsure which method to use, refer to the [Overview of Search Methods for Cases](overview-search-methods-case.md) topic.

## Method 1: Enter a case number search box

*Use this method if you already know the case number you're looking for.*

1. Enter the case number in the search box located at the top of the page, visible across all views.

## Method 2: Similar cases
