# About Tags

Tags assign labels to [cases](../about-cases.md), [alerts](../../alerts/about-alerts.md), and [observables](../observables/about-observables.md) in TheHive.

This topic explains how tags function.

## Sources

In TheHive, tags are created in two ways:

* [Taxonomy tags](../../../../administration/taxonomies/about-taxonomies.md): Created from an imported taxonomy
* [Custom tags](../../../organization/configure-organization/manage-custom-tags/about-custom-tags.md): Created manually by users as free text to cases, alerts, and observables, or automatically by connected external tools, [email servers](../../../../administration/email-intake-connector/about-email-intake-connectors.md), or [alert feeders](../../../organization/configure-organization/manage-feeders/about-feeders.md)

## Scope

* Taxonomy tags are available to all organizations within a TheHive instance.
* Custom tags are specific to a single organization and can't be shared between organizations or TheHive instances.
