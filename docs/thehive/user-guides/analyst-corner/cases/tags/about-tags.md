# About Tags

Tags allow you to assign labels to cases, alerts, and observables in TheHive.

## Sources

Tags can be created in TheHive in two ways:

* [Taxonomy tags](../../../../administration/taxonomies/about-taxonomies.md): Created from an imported taxonomy
* [Custom tags](../../../organization/custom-tags.md): Added manually as free text directly to cases, alerts, and observables

Tags are also added automatically by external tools.

## Scope

* Taxonomy tags are shared across all organizations within a TheHive instance.
* Custom tags are specific to a single organization and can't be shared between organizations or TheHive instances.

## Next steps

* []()
