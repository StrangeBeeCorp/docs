# About Case Timelines

<!-- md:license Gold --> <!-- md:license Platinum -->

Case timelines provide a chronological view of all events that occurred during the lifecycle of a specific case.

This topic explains the components of case timelines in TheHive.

{!includes/other-reports-cases-from-case-timelines.md!}

## Components

Case timelines consist of all types of events that have occurred in a case, including:

* Alert occurrences
* Case creation
* Investigation start
* Task completion
* Flagged [task logs](../../tasks/about-task-logs.md)
* Indicator of compromise (IOC) sightings
* MITRE ATT&CK patterns

[Configure custom events](add-custom-event-timeline.md) to include additional entries in the timeline.

## Rendering

Display case timelines as either a graph or a list.

## Actions

Custom events can be [created](add-custom-event-timeline.md) and [deleted](delete-custom-event-timeline.md), but can't be edited after creation.
