# How to Export an Archived Case

{!includes/license-required-export-import-case.md!}

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for exporting an archived [case](../cases/about-cases.md) in TheHive.

!!! warning "Only for TheHive use"
    TheHive configures exported cases to open only within the platform when you [create a case based on a past investigation](create-a-new-case.md#create-a-case-from-an-archived-case). Don't export an archived case for any other purpose, or you won't be able to open the file.

## Procedure

1. [Locate the case you want to export](../cases/search-for-cases/find-a-case.md).

2. In the case description, select the **Export** button.

3. Enter an archive password in the **Export as an archive** section. 

    This password will be required when [importing the archived case](../cases/create-a-new-case.md#create-a-case-from-an-archived-case).

4. Select **Export archive** to export the case in THAR format.
