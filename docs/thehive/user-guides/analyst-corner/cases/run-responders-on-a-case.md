# Run Responders and Review Reports for a Case

[Cortex responders](../../../administration/cortex/about-cortex.md) execute actions on cases, alerts, observables, tasks, and task logs.

Run responders on a [case](about-cases.md) to execute automated actions such as closing an external ticket or performing a predefined response within TheHive.

Responders execute actions on cases, alerts, observables, tasks, and task logs.

!!! note "Observables not included"
    Running a responder on a case doesn't run it on the observables linked to the case. To run responders on an observable, see [Run Responders and Review Reports for an Observable](./observables/run-responders-on-an-observable.md).

!!! tip "Running functions on a case"
    <!-- md:version 5.4 --> Did you know it’s possible to run functions on cases just like running responders? See [Run a Function on a Case or an Alert](../../organization/configure-organization/manage-functions/run-a-function-case-alert.md) for detailed instructions.

## Run responders on a case

1. [Locate the alert](./search-for-cases/find-a-case.md) on which you want to run responders.

2. In the case, select **Responders**.
