# Share an Observable with Other Organizations

<!-- md:permission `manageCase/update` --> <!-- md:permission `manageShare` -->

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for [manually sharing an observable in a shared case](../../../administration/organizations/about-organizations-sharing-rules.md#manual-sharing-of-tasks-and-observables-in-a-shared-case) with [linked organizations](../../../administration/organizations/link-an-organization.md) in TheHive.

!!! info "Shared cases only"
    To share an observable manually, the case must already be shared with the relevant linked organizations. If not, refer to [How to Share a Case](share-a-case.md).

This is useful when observable sharing rules are set to *manual*, ensuring that users share only the relevant observables.

To learn more about how sharing rules function and interact, see the [About Organizations Sharing Rules](../../../administration/organizations/about-organizations-sharing-rules.md) topic.
