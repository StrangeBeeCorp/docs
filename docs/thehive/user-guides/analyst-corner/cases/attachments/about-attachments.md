# About Attachments

Attachments are files linked to an organization, case, or alert. They store supporting materials—such as images, documents, or reports—that provide context or evidence.

This topic explains how attachments are managed in TheHive.

## Where to add attachments

### Organizations

Attachments can be manually added to organizations.

### Cases

Attachments can be added to cases. Case reports, images in case descriptions, summaries, and task logs, are automatically saved as attachments. You can also manually add files to the case or reports tabs.

Removing an image from a description, summary, or task log doesn't automatically remove it from the list of attachments.

### Alerts

Attachments can be added to alerts. Images in case descriptions and summaries are automatically saved as attachments. You can also manually add files.

Removing an image from a description or summary doesn't automatically remove it from the list of attachments.

## Format

Attachments are supported in any file format.

## Permissions
