# About Attachments

Attachments are files linked to an organization, case, or alert.

This topic explains how attachments are managed in TheHive.

## Where to add attachments

### Organizations

Attachments can be manually added to organizations.

### Cases

Attachments can be added to cases. Case reports, as well as images in case descriptions, summaries, and task logs, are automatically saved as attachments. You can also manually add files to the case or reports tabs.

Removing an image from a description, summary, or task log doesn't automatically remove it from the list of attachments.

### Alerts

Attachments can be manually added to alerts.

## Formats

Attachments are supported in any file format.

## Permissions

{!includes/access-manage-attachments.md!}

Once added, attachments can be viewed or downloaded by any user.
