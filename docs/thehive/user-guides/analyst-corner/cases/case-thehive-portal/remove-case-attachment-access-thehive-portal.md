# Remove External User Access to a Case Attachment

<!-- md:version 5.6 --> <!-- md:permission `manageCase/update` --> <!-- md:license Platinum -->

Remove external visibility from case attachments to prevent external users from accessing files through [TheHive Portal](../../../../administration/thehive-portal/about-thehive-portal.md). Attachments marked as internal are only visible to users who have access to the case through the main TheHive interface.

<h2>Procedure</h2>

1. [Locate the case](../search-for-cases/find-a-case.md) containing the attachment.

2. {% include-markdown "includes/attachments-tab-case-go-to.md" %}

3. Select :fontawesome-solid-ellipsis: next to the attachment.

    {% include-markdown "includes/filters.md" %}

4. Select **Internal**.

<h2>Next steps</h2>

* [Add an Attachment to a Case or an Alert](../attachments/add-an-attachment-case-alert.md)
