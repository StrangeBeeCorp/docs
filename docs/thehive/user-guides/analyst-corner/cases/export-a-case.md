# How to Export a Case

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for exporting a [case](../cases/about-cases.md) in TheHive.

You might need to export a case to:

* [Create a case from the exported case](create-a-new-case.md#create-a-case-from-an-archived-case)
* Share the case with MISP servers

## Procedure

1. [Locate the case you want to export](../cases/search-for-cases/find-a-case.md).

2. In the case description, select the **Export** button.

3. Two export options are available:

    * **Export as an archive**: If you want to export a case as an archive to create a case from the exported case, enter an archive password. This password will be required when [importing the archived case](../cases/create-a-new-case.md#create-a-case-from-an-archived-case).

    * **Export to MISP**: If you want to export a case to MISP servers, select the relevant servers for the case.

4. Select **Export archive** or **Export**.
