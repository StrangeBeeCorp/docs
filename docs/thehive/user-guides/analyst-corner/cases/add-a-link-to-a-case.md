# How to Add a Link to a Case

Each link is categorized to reflect the relationship type. If you don't indicate any category, the category *Internal link* will be automatically added when linking TheHive cases, and *External link* when linking external resoruces.

Existing categories appear when you select the field. If you enter a new category, it will be created automatically.
