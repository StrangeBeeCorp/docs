# How to Add a Link to a Case

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for adding a link to a [case](../cases/about-cases.md#linking-elements) in TheHive.

The link can point to another TheHive case or to an external resource.

{!includes/case-links-v55.md!}

{!includes/access-manage-case-links.md!}

## Procedure

1. [Find the case](../cases/search-for-cases/find-a-case.md) where you want to add the link.

2. {!includes/linked-elements-section.md!}

3. Select :fontawesome-regular-square-plus: or **Add a link**.

4. Enter the following information:

    **- Link type**

    Link type specifies the category for the link. Existing categories appear when you click the field. Entering a new category automatically creates it when you add the link.

    If you don't specify a category, *Internal link* is applied by default when linking TheHive cases, and *External link* when linking external resources.

    **- Case or external URL**

    Search for the case by number or title, or paste an external URL.

5. Select :fontawesome-solid-check:.
