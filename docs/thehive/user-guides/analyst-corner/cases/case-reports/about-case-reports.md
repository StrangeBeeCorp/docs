# About Case Report

<!-- md:license Platinum -->

A case report is available for each individual case and displays key data from the case.

This topic provides an overview of case reports and their usage in TheHive.

!!! tip "Multiple cases reporting"
    To generate reports for multiple cases at once, refer to the [About Dashboards](../../dashboard/about-dashboards.md) topic.

## Templates

When displaying a report, users select [a case report template](../../../organization/configure-organization/manage-templates/case-report-templates/about-case-report-templates.md), which determines both the data displayed and its presentation.

## Formats

Several formats are available for downloading case reports:

* HTML
* Markdown
* Word

## Permissions

Case reports are available to all users in your organization within case descriptions for preview. However, only users with the `manageCaseReport` permission can save and download them. Once saved, the reports are available for download to all users in the **Attachments** tab.
