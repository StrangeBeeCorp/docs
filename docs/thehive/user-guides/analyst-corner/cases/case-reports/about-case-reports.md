# About Case Report

<!-- md:license Platinum -->

A case report is available for each individual [case](../about-cases.md) and displays key data from the case.

This topic provides an overview of case reports and their usage in TheHive.

## Templates

When displaying a report, [a case report template](../../../organization/configure-organization/manage-templates/case-report-templates/about-case-report-templates.md) is selected to determine both the data displayed and its presentation.

Users have access to the default template and all [additional case report templates created](../../../organization/configure-organization/manage-templates/case-report-templates/create-a-case-report-template.md).

## Formats

Three formats are available for downloading case reports:

* HTML
* Markdown
* Word

## Permissions

Case reports are available to all users in an organization within case descriptions for preview. However, only users with the `manageCaseReport` permission can save and download them. Once saved, the reports are available for download to all users in the **Attachments** tab.
