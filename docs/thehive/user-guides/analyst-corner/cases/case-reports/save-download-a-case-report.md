<h2>Procedure</h2>

1. [Locate the case](../search-for-cases/find-a-case.md).

2. In the case description, select the **Report** tab.

    ![Case report tab](/thehive/images/user-guides/analyst-corner/cases/report-tab.png)

3. In the right pane, under the **General** section, select the template you want to apply, the format, and the maximum number of elements displayed per widget.

    !!! tip "Can't find a case report template?"
        If you can't find the case report template you need, it might not exist yet, or someone may have deleted it. Contact someone with the `manageCaseReportTemplate` permission to [create a new template](../../../organization/configure-organization/manage-templates/case-report-templates/create-a-case-report-template.md) or [modify an existing one](../../../organization/configure-organization/manage-templates/case-report-templates/add-remove-widgets-case-report-template.md).

    !!! info "Maximum number of elements per widget"
        The element limit set here applies only to the report preview and doesn't affect the number of elements included when saving or downloading the report. Increasing the number of elements for preview may impact performance.

5. Check the preview to ensure everything is correct.

6. Select **Save and download**. 

    !!! info "Saved files access"
        This action downloads the file to your computer and also saves it in the **Attachments** tab. Any user can then access and download it from there.
