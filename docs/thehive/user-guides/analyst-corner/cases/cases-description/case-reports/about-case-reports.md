# About Case Reports

Case reports allow you to visualize all data related to a specific case in one place.

This topic explains the components of case reports in TheHive.

## Templates

A [template](../../../../organization/configure-organization/manage-templates/case-report-templates/about-case-report-templates.md) must be applied to visualize a case report.

A default template is available for users, and [additional case report templates can be created](../../../../organization/configure-organization/manage-templates/case-report-templates/create-a-case-report-template.md) by users with the necessary permissions.

## Formats

Case reports are available in three formats:

* Markdown
* HTML
* Word
