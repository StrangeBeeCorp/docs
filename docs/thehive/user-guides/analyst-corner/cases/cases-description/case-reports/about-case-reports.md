# About Case Reports

Case reports allow you to visualize all data related to a specific case in one place.

This topic explains the components of case reports in TheHive.

## Templates

You must apply a [template](../../../../organization/configure-organization/manage-templates/case-report-templates/about-case-report-templates.md) to visualize a case report.

Users have access to a default template, and those with the necessary permissions can [create additional case report templates](../../../../organization/configure-organization/manage-templates/case-report-templates/create-a-case-report-template.md).

## Formats

Case reports are available in three formats:

* Markdown
* HTML
* Word

## Permissions
