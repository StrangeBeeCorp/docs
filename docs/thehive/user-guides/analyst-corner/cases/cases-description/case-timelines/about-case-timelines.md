# About Case Timelines

Case timelines provide a chronological view of all events that occurred during the lifecycle of a specific case.

This topic explains the components of case timelines in TheHive.

## Components

Case timelines consist of all types of events that have occurred in a case, including:

* Alert occurrences
* Case creation
* Investigation start
* Task completion
* Flagged task logs
* IoC sightings
* MITRE ATT&CK patterns

You can also [configure custom events](add-custom-event-timeline.md) to include additional entries in the timeline.

## Rendering

You can display case timelines as either a graph or a list.

## Actions

You can [create](add-custom-event-timeline.md) and [delete](delete-custom-event-timeline.md) a custom event, but you can't edit it after creation.

## Next steps

* [Add a Custom Event to a Case Timeline](add-custom-event-timeline.md)
* [Delete a Custom Event in a Case Timeline](delete-custom-event-timeline.md)
* [View a Case Timeline](view-case-timeline.md)
* [Export a Case Timeline](export-case-timeline.md)
