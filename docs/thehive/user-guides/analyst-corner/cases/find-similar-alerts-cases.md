# Find Similar Alerts or Cases

Find similar [alerts](../alerts/about-alerts.md) and [cases](about-cases.md) in TheHive to identify related incidents and correlate information across your investigations. Similarity checks between cases and alerts are based on [observables](../cases/observables/about-observables.md#similar-alerts-and-cases).
