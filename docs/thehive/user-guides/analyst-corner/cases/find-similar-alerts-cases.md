# Find Similar Alerts or Cases

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for finding similar alerts and cases in TheHive.

Similarity checks between cases and alerts are based on [observables](../cases/observables/about-observables.md#similar-alerts-and-cases).

Use this procedure to identify similar cases or to correlate alerts with other alerts or with ongoing cases.
