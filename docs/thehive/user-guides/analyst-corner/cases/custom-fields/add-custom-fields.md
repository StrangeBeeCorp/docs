This topic provides step-by-step instructions for adding [custom fields](../custom-fields/about-custom-fields.md) to a [case](about-cases.md) or an [alert](../alerts/about-alerts.md) in TheHive.

    If you can't find the custom field you need, it might not exist yet or may have been deleted. Contact someone with admin-level permissions to [create or restore it](../../../administration/custom-fields/create-a-custom-field.md).
