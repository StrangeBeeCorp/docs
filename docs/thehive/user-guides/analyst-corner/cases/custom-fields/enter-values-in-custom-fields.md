# How to Enter Values in Custom Fields

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for entering values in [custom fields](../../../../administration/custom-fields/about-custom-fields.md) in a [case](../about-cases.md) or an [alert](../../alerts/about-alerts.md) in TheHive.

!!! tip "Why can't I enter a value in a custom field?"
    If you can't enter the value you need in a custom field, the field may not be configured correctly. Contact someone with admin-level permissions to [update the configuration](../../../../administration/custom-fields/edit-a-custom-field.md).

## Procedure

1. Find the [case](../../cases/search-for-cases/find-a-case.md) or the [alert](../../alerts/search-for-alerts/find-an-alert.md) where you want to enter values in custom fields.

2. {!includes/custom-fields-section-go-to.md!}

3. Enter a value under the custom field name.

    Depending on the configuration, the field will either accept free text or provide a dropdown list of options.

    !!! tip "Available since version 5.5"
        Starting with version 5.5, you can filter mandatory custom fields and choose how many custom fields to display per line.

4. Optional: Select **Add** to enter another value, if available.

5. Optional: To remove incorrect values, select :fontawesome-solid-trash: or :fontawesome-solid-xmark: next to the value you want to delete.

6. Select **Confirm**.
