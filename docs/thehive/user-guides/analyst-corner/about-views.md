# About Views

Views save [filters and sorting](about-filtering-and-sorting.md) applied to a list in TheHive.

This topic explains how views function in TheHive.

!!! info "Beta feature available for filters and views"
    <!-- md:version 5.5.4 --> A beta feature to enhance user experience for filters and views is available for testing on lists of cases, alerts, tasks, and observables. For detailed instructions on how to activate this beta feature, see [Activate the Beta of Filters and Views](../../user-guides/manage-user-settings.md#activate-the-beta-of-filters-and-views).

## Default view

A *Default* view without filters or sorting is always available. Modifying or deleting this view isn't permitted.

## Saving views

Applying a new filter or sorting displays an asterisk (*\**) next to the view name:

* Select **Save view** to save changes to the current view.
* Select **Save view as** to save changes as a new view.

## Actions

Switching views occurs by selecting the view name in the top-left corner of the screen.

Deleting existing views requires selecting **Manage views**.

Renaming existing views isn't supported.

## Scope

Views are user-specific and list-specific, meaning each user has access to their own saved views, which apply only to a specific list.

## Behavior

The last used view is automatically applied by default when accessing a list.
