# About Views

Views save [filters and sorting](about-filtering-and-sorting.md) applied to a list in TheHive.

This topic explains how views function in TheHive.

## Default view

A *Default* view without filters or sorting is always available. Modifying or deleting this view isn't permitted.

## Saving views

Applying a new filter or sorting displays an asterisk (*\**) next to the view name:

* Select **Save view** to save changes to the current view.
* Select **Save view as** to save changes as a new view.

## Actions

Switching views occurs by selecting the view name in the top-left corner of the screen.

Deleting existing views requires selecting **Manage views**.

Renaming existing views isn't supported.

## Scope

Views are user-specific and list-specific, meaning each user has access to their own saved views, which apply only to a specific list.

## Behavior

The last used view is automatically applied by default when accessing a list.
