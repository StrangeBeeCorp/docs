# About Autorefresh

Autorefresh is a feature that automatically refreshes lists to display new elements in TheHive.

## Update frequency

When turned on, autorefresh updates the lists every time there is an event worth mentioning in the [live feed](about-live-feed.md).

## Manual refresh

If users prefer not to configure autorefresh, they can still manually update their lists.
