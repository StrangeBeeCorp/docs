# Detail View vs. Preview

TheHive offers two ways to view information about [cases](./cases/about-cases.md), [alerts](./alerts/about-alerts.md), [tasks](./tasks/about-tasks.md), [observables](./cases/observables/about-observables.md), [TTPs](../../administration/ttps/view-techniques-in-a-catalog.md), [user accounts](../organization/configure-organization/manage-user-accounts/about-user-accounts.md), and [organizations](../../administration/organizations/about-organizations.md): detail views provide complete information and all available actions, while previews offer quick summaries without leaving your current view.

## What's the difference

A detail view appears when you select an item. It opens a full page showing all available information and actions.

A preview appears when you hover over an item and select the :fontawesome-solid-eye: button. It opens a drawer with a summary—without leaving your current view. If needed, you can access the full detail view directly from the preview.
