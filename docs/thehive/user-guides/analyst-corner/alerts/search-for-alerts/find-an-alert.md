# How to Find an Alert

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for using various methods to search for an alert in TheHive.

If youâ€™re unsure which method to use, refer to the [Overview of Search Methods for Alerts](overview-search-methods-alert.md) topic.

## Method 1: Similar alerts

*If you want to find one or more alerts similar to a known alert or need to search for multiple alerts to perform actions on them simultaneously.*

1. Open a case, an alert, or a task, and select the **Similar cases** tab.
