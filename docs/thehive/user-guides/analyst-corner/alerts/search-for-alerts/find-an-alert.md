# How to Find an Alert

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for using various methods to search for an [alert](../about-alerts.md) in TheHive.

If youâ€™re unsure which method to use, refer to the [Overview of Search Methods for Alerts](overview-search-methods-alert.md) topic.

!!! tip "Can't find an alert?"
    Ensure [autorefresh](../../about-autorefresh.md) is turned on to automatically display new alerts in lists.

## Method 1: Similar alerts

*Use this method if you want to find one or more alerts similar to a known alert and need to perform actions on them simultaneously.*

1. Open a case, an alert, or a task, and select the **Similar alerts** tab.

3. Enter the keywords you want to search for in the search box displayed by default.

    !!! tip "<!-- md:version 5.4.7 --> Wildcard character"
        You can use the wildcard character *\** to broaden your searches.

        The wildcard character acts as a placeholder that matches zero or more characters, helping you find variations of a term or incomplete information.
        
        Examples of use cases:  
        - Email domains: Entering *\*@gmail.com* will return entities containing the gmail.com domain.  
        - IP subnets: Entering *192.168.\*.\** will return entities with IP addresses in the 192.168.x.x subnet.  
        - URLs: Entering *https://malwaredomain.com/\** will return entities hosted under the malwaredomain.com directory.

        Other advanced search options, such as Boolean and phrase searches, are not currently supported.
