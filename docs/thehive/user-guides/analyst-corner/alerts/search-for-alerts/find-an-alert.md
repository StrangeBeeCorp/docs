# Find an Alert

Search for [alerts](../about-alerts.md) in TheHive using different methods depending on your needs—from quick searches to advanced filtering.

If you’re unsure which method to use, refer to the [Overview of Search Methods for Alerts](overview-search-methods-alert.md) topic.

!!! tip "Can't find an alert?"
    Ensure [autorefresh](../../about-autorefresh.md) is turned on to automatically display new alerts in lists.

## Method 1: Similar alerts

*Use this method if you want to find one or more alerts similar to a known alert and need to perform actions on them simultaneously.*

{% include-markdown "includes/similar-cases-alerts-filters.md" %}

1. Open a case, an alert, or a task, and select the **Similar alerts** tab.

    ![Similar alerts](../../../../images/user-guides/analyst-corner/cases/similar-alerts.png)

2. {% include-markdown "includes/apply-filters.md" %}

3. {% include-markdown "includes/search-results.md" %}

For more information, see the [Find Similar Alerts and Cases](../../cases/find-similar-alerts-cases.md) topic.
