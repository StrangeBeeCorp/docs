# How to Unlink an Alert and a Case

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for unlinking an [alert](about-alerts.md) and a [case](../cases/about-cases.md) in TheHive.

An alert is automatically linked to a case when you [merge it into a new case](merge-an-alert-into-a-new-case.md) or [an existing one](merge-an-alert-into-an-existing-case.md).

<h2>Procedure</h2>

1. [Find the case](../cases/search-for-cases/find-a-case.md) where you want to unlink alerts.

2. {!includes/linked-alerts-tab-go-to.md!}

3. Select :fontawesome-solid-ellipsis: next to the alert you want to unlink.

    {!includes/filters-sorts-views.md!}
