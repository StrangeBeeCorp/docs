## Definition

An alert is a security event generated by detection tools such as SIEM, IDS, EDR, firewalls, or threat intelligence platforms like MISP. It serves as an early warning that helps analysts identify, investigate, and respond to potential threats. Alerts can be reviewed, triaged, and transformed into cases for deeper investigation.

## Key components

In TheHive, an alert consists of the following elements:

* [Observables](../alerts/alerts-description/view-observables.md): Data points such as IP addresses, file hashes, domains, and email addresses that are relevant to an investigation.

* [TTPs](../alerts/alerts-description/view-ttps.md): The methods and strategies used by attackers.

## Sources

In TheHive, an alert can be created from the following sources:

* Detection tools such as SIEM, IDS, EDR, or firewalls.

* Threat intelligence platforms like MISP.
