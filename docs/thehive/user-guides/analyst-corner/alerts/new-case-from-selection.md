# Creating a New Case from Selection

This section provides guidance on creating a new case from a selected alert.

On the main alerts page, where all alerts are displayed, there are various types of alerts, including new and imported ones. The **New Case from Selection** option is only available for new alerts listed.

## Important Notes

- **Single Case Creation**: The **New Case from Selection** option allows the creation of only one case, regardless of how many alerts are selected.
- **Merge Action**: Similarly, the merge button also merges only one case at a time, regardless of the number of selected alerts.

For bulk actions, such as creating multiple cases or merging multiple alerts, use the bulk action buttons available at the top of the alerts list.
