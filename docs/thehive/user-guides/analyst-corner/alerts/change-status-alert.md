# How to Change an Alert Status

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for changing the [status](about-statuses.md) of an [alert](../alerts/about-alerts.md) in TheHive.

!!! tip "Why can't I find a status?"
    If you can't find the status you need, it may be due to one of the following reasons:  
    - The status is not available from the alert description page. Statuses linked to the *In progress* stage are only accessible when [starting work on an alert](../alerts/alerts-description/actions.md#start). Statuses linked to the *Closed* stage are only accessible when [closing an alert](../alerts/alerts-description/actions.md#close).  
    - The status doesn't exist yet, or someone may have deleted or hidden it. Contact someone with admin-level permissions to [create it](../../../administration/status/create-a-status.md) or [restore it](../../../administration/status/change-visibility-of-a-status.md).
