# How to Merge an Alert into an Existing Case

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for merging an [alert](about-alerts.md) into an existing [case](../cases/about-cases.md) in TheHive.

During triage, merge an alert into an existing case if a similar investigation is already ongoing.

If it requires a separate investigation, [import the alert into a new case](../cases/create-a-new-case.md#create-a-case-from-an-alert).
