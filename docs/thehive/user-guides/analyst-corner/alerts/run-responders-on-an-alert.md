# How to Run Responders and Review Reports for an Alert

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for running [responders](../../../../administration/cortex/about-cortex.md) on an [alert](about-alerts.md) and reviewing responder reports in TheHive.

Responders execute response actions on cases, alerts, observables, tasks, and task logs.

Run a responder on an alert to take actions such as closing an external ticket or executing a predefined response within TheHive.
