# How to Run Responders and Review Reports for an Alert

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for running [responders](../../../administration/cortex/about-cortex.md) on an [alert](about-alerts.md) and reviewing responder reports in TheHive.

Responders execute actions on cases, alerts, observables, tasks, and task logs.

Run a responder on an alert to take actions such as closing an external ticket or executing a predefined response within TheHive.

!!! note "Observables not included"
    Running a responder on an alert doesn't run it on the observables linked to the alert. To run responders on an observable, see [Run Responders and Review Reports for an Observable](../cases/observables/run-responders-on-an-observable.md).

!!! tip "Running functions on an alert"
    <!-- md:version 5.4 --> Did you know itâ€™s possible to run functions on alerts just like running responders? See [Run a Function on a Case or an Alert](../../organization/configure-organization/manage-functions/run-a-function-case-alert.md) for detailed instructions.
