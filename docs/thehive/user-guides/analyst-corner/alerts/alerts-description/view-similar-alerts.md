## Observable Preview Drawer

The Observable Preview Drawer allows you to view observables that are common between two events, such as alerts or cases. This feature is resource-intensive, and to optimize performance, there is a limit of 100 observables displayed in this drawer.

**Note:** This limit can be adjusted by the platform administrator in the `application.conf` file. However, modifying this limitation may affect the performance of the application. We cannot guarantee optimal performance if the limit is increased beyond 100 observables.
