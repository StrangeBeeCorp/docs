!!! Warning "Important Notes"
      - **Single Case Creation**: The **New Case from Selection** option allows the creation of only one case, regardless of how many alerts are selected.
      - **Merge Action**: Similarly, the merge button also merges only one case at a time, regardless of the number of selected alerts.

      For bulk actions, such as creating multiple cases or merging multiple alerts, use the bulk action buttons available at the top of the alerts list.
