# About Filtering and Sorting

This topic explains how filtering and sorting work in TheHive.

## Filtering elements

Filtering in TheHive allows you to refine displayed lists across various views.

### Applying filters

To apply filters, turn on the **Filters** toggle at the top right of the page to access filtering options and manually enter filter values.

If you prefer not to enter values manually, you can use these quicker alternatives when available:

* Using predefined quick filters

Select the **Quick filters** dropdown to access predefined filters. These filters are available to all users and can't be modified.

* Selecting values directly from a list

Select specific values within a list to apply filters dynamically.

### Filter logic

Filters are combined using the `AND` operator, meaning all selected conditions must be met.

### Saving filters

You can save applied filters in [a view](about-views.md) to avoid reapplying them each time. Simply select the saved view whenever needed.

## Sorting elements

### Applying sorting

Sorting in TheHive allows you to organize displayed lists across various views.

You can sort lists by many fields.

Select the small arrows next to a field name to sort the list in ascending or descending order. The first click sorts in ascending order, the second click sorts in descending order, and the third click removes sorting.

When sorting is applied, the field name and the selected arrow are highlighted.

### Sorting logic

You can't combine sorting on multiple fieldsâ€”only one field can be sorted at a time.

### Saving sorting

You can save applied sorting in [a view](about-views.md) to avoid reapplying it each time. Simply select the saved view whenever needed.
