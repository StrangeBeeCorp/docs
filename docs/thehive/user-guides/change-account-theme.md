# Change your Account Theme

<!-- md:version 5.4 -->

TheHive uses the light theme by default for all users.

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for changing the user interface theme of your [user account](../user-guides/organization/configure-organization/manage-user-accounts/about-user-accounts.md) in TheHive.
