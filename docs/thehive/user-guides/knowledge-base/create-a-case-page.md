# How to Create a Case Page

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for creating a [case page](about-case-pages.md) in TheHive.

Use this procedure to store temporary, case-specific knowledge that’s useful during investigations but isn’t retained long term. To preserve information from case pages for the long term, manually copy the content to a [Knowledge Base page](about-knowledge-base.md).

<h2>Procedure</h2>

1. [Find the case](../analyst-corner/cases/search-for-cases/find-a-case.md) where you want to add a page.

2. {!includes/pages-tab-go-to.md!}

3. Select **Add a page** or :fontawesome-solid-plus:.

4. Select one of the following options:

    **Create new page**
    
    To start with a blank page

    Enter the following information:

    * Title: The title of your page.
    * Category: The category your page belongs to. Pages are visually grouped by category for easier navigation. If the category doesn't exist, it will be created automatically.
    
    **Use an existing page template**
    
    To apply a [case page template](../organization/configure-organization/manage-templates/case-page-templates/about-case-page-templates.md) to your new page

    Select one or more templates. The icons next to the selected pages turn green when selected.

5. Select **Add page**.

6. Select :fontawesome-solid-pen:.

7. Write your content using [TheHive-flavored Markdown syntax](../thehive-flavored-markdown.md).
