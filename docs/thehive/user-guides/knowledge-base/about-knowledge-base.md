# About the Knowledge Base

The Knowledge Base in TheHive enables the creation and sharing of valuable information within a team. It supports documenting lessons learned, writing reports, recording meeting notes, and sharing content that enhances collaboration and knowledge sharing.

## Organization-wide sharing

Knowledge Base pages are shared across the entire organization and accessible to all users.

## Permanent vs. temporary documentation

The Knowledge Base stores knowledge intended for long-term preservation and future reference. For temporary documentation—useful during active investigations but not meant to be retained permanently—use [case pages](about-case-pages.md) instead.

## Flavored Markdown

Knowledge Base pages use [TheHive-flavored Markdown syntax](../thehive-flavored-markdown.md) for formatting.

## Permissions

Only users with the `manageKnowledgeBase` permission can manage the Knowledge Base in TheHive.

Users with the necessary permissions can edit and delete any page, regardless of who created it.
