# About the Knowledge Base

The Knowledge Base in TheHive allows you to create and share valuable information with your team. You can document lessons learned, write reports, record meeting notes, or share any content that helps improve collaboration and knowledge sharing.

This topic explains how to use the Knowledge Base effectively to support teamwork and ensure that important information is easily accessible to your team.

## Structure

The Knowledge Base is organized into pages, which can be created at two levels:

* Organization level: Share information that is relevant across the entire organization.
* Case level: Document details specific to individual cases.

## Templates

[Templates](../organization/configure-organization/manage-templates/case-page-templates/about-case-page-templates.md) are available exclusively for case-level pages. Organization-level pages do not support templates.

## Flavored Markdown

Knowledge Base pages use [TheHive-flavored Markdown syntax](../thehive-flavored-markdown.md) for formatting.

## Permissions

{!includes/access-knowledge-base.md!}

After a page is created at the organization level, it is visible to all users. At the case level, it is visible only to users with access to the case.
