# About the Knowledge Base

The Knowledge Base in TheHive enables the creation and sharing of valuable information within a team. It supports documenting lessons learned, writing reports, recording meeting notes, and sharing content that enhances collaboration and knowledge sharing.

This topic describes how the Knowledge Base supports teamwork and ensures important information remains available to the team.

## Structure

The Knowledge Base organizes content into pages, which can be created at two levels:

* Organization level: Share information that's relevant across the entire organization.
* Case level: Document details specific to individual cases.

## Templates

[Templates](../organization/configure-organization/manage-templates/case-page-templates/about-case-page-templates.md) are available exclusively for case-level pages. Organization-level pages don't support templates.

## Flavored Markdown

Knowledge Base pages use [TheHive-flavored Markdown syntax](../thehive-flavored-markdown.md) for formatting.

## Permissions

{!includes/access-knowledge-base.md!}

Pages created at the organization level are visible to all users. Pages created at the case level are visible only to users with access to that case.
