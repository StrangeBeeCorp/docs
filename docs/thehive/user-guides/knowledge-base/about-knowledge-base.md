# About the Knowledge Base

The Knowledge Base in TheHive enables the creation and sharing of valuable information within a team. It supports documenting lessons learned, writing reports, recording meeting notes, and sharing content that enhances collaboration and knowledge sharing.

This topic describes how the Knowledge Base supports teamwork and ensures important information remains available to the team.

## Organization-wide sharing

Knowledge Base pages are shared across the entire organization and accessible to all users.

## Permanent vs. temporary documentation

The Knowledge Base stores knowledge intended for long-term preservation and future reference. For temporary documentation—useful during active investigations but not meant to be retained permanently—use [case pages](about-case-pages.md) instead.

## Flavored Markdown

Knowledge Base pages use [TheHive-flavored Markdown syntax](../thehive-flavored-markdown.md) for formatting.

## Permissions

{% include-markdown "includes/access-knowledge-base.md" %}
