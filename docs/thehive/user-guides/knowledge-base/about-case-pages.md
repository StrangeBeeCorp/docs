# About Case Pages

Case pages in TheHive enable the creation and sharing of valuable information within a team on a specific [case](../analyst-corner/cases/about-cases.md). They support documenting lessons learned, writing reports, recording meeting notes, and sharing content that enhances collaboration and knowledge sharing.

This topic describes how case pages support teamwork and ensures important information remains available to the team.

## Permanent vs. temporary documentation

Case pages are intended for temporary documentation, useful during investigations but not necessarily retained long-term, and they can't be searched. In contrast, [Knowledge Base pages](about-knowledge-base.md) store knowledge that should be preserved for future reference. To retain information from case pages, manually copy the content to a Knowledge Base page.

## Templates

[Templates](../../user-guides/organization/configure-organization/manage-templates/case-page-templates/about-case-page-templates.md) are available for case pages.

## Flavored Markdown

Case pages use [TheHive-flavored Markdown syntax](../thehive-flavored-markdown.md) for formatting.

## Permissions

Only users with the `managePage` permission can manage case pages in TheHive.

Users with the necessary permissions can edit and delete any page, regardless of who created it.
