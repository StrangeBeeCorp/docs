# Automate Tracking of Pending Alerts

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for automating the tracking of pending [alerts](./analyst-corner/alerts/about-alerts.md) in TheHive.

Use this procedure to automatically highlight and notify managers about all pending alerts that remain in a status *New* after a specified number of hours and are still unassigned.

## Create a custom status

Follow instructions detailed in [Create a Status](../administration/status/create-a-status.md) to create a new status called *TOREVIEW* linked to the *New* stage.
