## 5.5.0 - April 22, 2025

### New features

#### Private cases: Restrict access to sensitive cases

You can now [restrict access to sensitive cases](../user-guides/analyst-corner/cases/about-cases.md#case-visibility) to designated team members and managers.

#### Alert feeders

An [alert feeder](../user-guides/organization/configure-organization/manage-feeders/about-feeders.md) is a connector that periodically requests data from an external HTTP REST API and converts it into an alert using a TheHive function. It enables data retrieval in pull mode from services that can't push or post data to TheHive's public API.

#### Case links: Link external or internal elements to a case

You can now [link cases](../user-guides/analyst-corner/cases/about-cases.md#linking-elements) to each other and to external URLs, offering a comprehensive view of related information directly within the **General** tab. Additionally, when you create a case from a MISP alert or merge a MISP alert into a case, the MISP URL associated with the alert is added as an external link.

#### Table widget in dashboard

The [table widget](../user-guides/analyst-corner/dashboard/widgets-dashboards.md#table-widget) displays a list of entities (cases, alerts, or tasks) in a tabular format. You can customize the columns, apply advanced filters, and select sorting options. This can be used to view action-required cases directly on a dashboard.

#### New Markdown content formatting options

You now have access to three new improvements in [the Markdown formatting options](../user-guides/thehive-flavored-markdown.md):

* The ability to use the `<br />`, `<br/>`, or `<br>` HTML tags to break lines within table cells
* Code blocks with syntax highlighting
* Admonition blocks of types error, warning, success, or info

#### New OpenID SSO provider

TheHive now supports integration with an [OpenID authentication provider](../administration/authentication/openid.md), offering users Single Sign-On (SSO) access. While authentication via SAML and OAuth 2.0 was previously supported, OpenID, built on the OAuth2 authorization layer, simplifies the authentication process.

#### Hide predefined statuses

You can now [hide predefined statuses](../administration/status/change-visibility-of-a-status.md) for cases and alerts, allowing users to see only the custom statuses youâ€™ve created. This provides a cleaner, more organized status list, displaying only relevant information for an improved user experience.

#### MS Graph API for email intakes

The [Microsoft 365 Graph API connector](../administration/email-intake-connector/connect-a-mailbox.md) is now available for email intakes. It uses the standard API recommended by Microsoft to connect and retrieve emails from a Microsoft mailbox.

#### Case report templates: Display the description of custom events

You can now hide or show the description of custom events in the [timeline widget](../user-guides/organization/configure-organization/manage-templates/case-report-templates/widgets-case-report-templates.md#timeline-widget) within case reports.

### Improvements

#### Taxonomy drawer

The taxonomies component has been redesigned to provide an improved user experience.

#### Better user experience for custom fields

The display of custom fields has been improved for better consistency and intuitiveness, making data entry and management more efficient while reducing errors.

#### Images in descriptions

You can now display full-size images by dropping them directly into the descriptions of cases, alerts, and task logs. This improvement complements the existing attachment system, which displays images as attachments.

#### Status visibility in the Tasks tab of cases

The status of tasks is now clearly visible in each row of the **Tasks** tab in cases, enabling quick identification without needing to open the details.

#### Public API observable route optimization

The observable creation routes in alerts and cases have been optimized, making the creation of dozens of observables five times faster.

### Fixes

#### UI

##### Dark Mode

* Corrected rendering of tag colors in report analyzers.
* Fixed color display for failure messages on dashboards.

#### Others

* MISP server connection: Improved by trimming the server URL.
* Attachment tab on cases: Fixed the counter to display the correct number. Filtering and sorting of attachments now work correctly.
* Case and alert closure: Added the ability to input multiple values in custom fields.
* Dashboards: 
    * Selecting *Audit* in the **Entity** field is no longer allowed for any widget. Previously created widgets remain unaffected.
    * Fixed an issue when using a date-type custom field as the date field in the widget.
* Case export to MISP: Fixed an issue with attachments when exporting a case to MISP.
* Merged alert audits: Fixed a regression introduced in [version 5.4.8](release-notes-5.4.md) related to the JSON audit object of merged alerts. In the audit, the `object.*` field refers to the merged alert, while the `context.*` object refers to the case where the alert has been merged.
* Notification form: Improved the performance of the filteredEvent input.
