# Notifications

TheHive Notifications allows you to automatically react on specific events occurring in TheHive and send notification to defined Endpoints.

Endpoints can be:
- Cortex

Endpoints need to be configured before using them in Notifications.
You can also send an Email as notification. 

## Notification management
