# How to Upgrade from API v0 to API v1

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for upgrading from API v0 to API v1, in response to the [API v0 deprecation](API-v0-deprecation-notice.md) in TheHive.

!!! info "Are you concerned?"
    
    Use this procedure if you:
    - Call API endpoints that include `/v0/` or don't specify a version
    - Use the TH4PY Python client version 1.8, which relies on API v0

    You might trigger these calls directly or through automationâ€”such as analyzers, responders, scripts, or connectors.

    If you're unsure, see the [API v0 Deprecation Notice](API-v0-deprecation-notice.md) for tests you can run to verify your setup.

## Update the API routes to use API v1
