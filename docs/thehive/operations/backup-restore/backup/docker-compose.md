# Backup a stack run with Docker Compose

!!! Note
    This solution assumes you are following our _[Running with Docker](./../../../installation/docker.md)_ guide to run your application stack.


---
## Introduction

The backup procedure is designed to capture the state of your application stack in three simple steps:

1. Stop all services to ensure data consistency and prevent any changes during the backup process.
2. Copy volumes and mapped directories on the host machine, which contain your data, configurations, and logs.
3. Restart the services to resume normal operations after the backup is complete.


---
## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure:

* You have sufficient storage space for the backup.
* Administrative privileges to stop and start Docker Compose services.
* Familiarity with the locations of your mapped volumes and data directories.

This step-by-step procedure ensures a safe and consistent backup of your Docker Compose stack, enabling quick recovery in case of an issue or migration to a new environment. For more details on restoring these backups, refer to the [restore procedure for Docker Compose](../restore/docker-compose.md).



---
## Step-by-step instructions

### Stop the services

!!! Example ""

    ```bash
    docker compose down 
    ```

### Copy files in a backup folder

For example, on the host server, create a folder on a dedicated NFS volume named `/opt/backups` and copy all files preserving their permissions

!!! Example ""

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    ## ============================================================
    ## RESTORE SCRIPT FOR THEHIVE APPLICATION STACK
    ## ============================================================
    ## PURPOSE:
    ## This script restores a backup of TheHive application stack, 
    ## including its configuration, data, and logs. It is designed to 
    ## recover from backups created using the associated backup script.
    ##
    ## IMPORTANT:
    ## - A backup is highly recommended before running a restore operation. 
    ##   This ensures you can revert to the current state if anything goes wrong.
    ## - Ensure that the target data folders are empty before running this script. 
    ##   Pre-existing files can cause conflicts or data corruption during the restore process.
    ## - This script must be run with sufficient permissions to overwrite 
    ##   application data and modify service configurations.
    ## - Ensure the backup folder path is correct and contains all required 
    ##   files and data.
    ##
    ## DISCLAIMER:
    ## - Users are strongly advised to test this script in a non-production 
    ##   environment to ensure it works as expected with their specific 
    ##   infrastructure and application stack before using it in production.
    ## - The maintainers of this script are not responsible for any data loss, 
    ##   corruption, or issues arising from the use of this script during your 
    ##   backup or restore processes. Proceed at your own risk.
    ##
    ## USAGE:
    ## 1. Update the variables at the start of the script to reflect your setup:
    ##    - BACKUP_ROOT_FOLDER: Path to the root directory of your backups.
    ##    - BACKUP_TO_RESTORE: Name of the backup folder to restore.
    ## 2. Run the script using the following command:
    ##    `bash ./scripts/restore.sh`
    ##
    ## ADDITIONAL RESOURCES:
    ## Refer to the official documentation for detailed instructions and 
    ## additional information: https://docs.strangebee.com/thehive/operations/backup-restore/
    ##
    ## WARNING:
    ## - This script ensure Nginx, Elasticsearch, Cassandra, and TheHive services are stopped before performing the restore, and then restarts the services.
    ## - This script will overwrite existing data. Use it with caution.
    ## - Do not modify the rest of the script unless necessary.

### Restart the services

!!! Example ""

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

---
## Validation

check the backup folder and verify the data has been well copied.

!!! Tip
    * A comprehensive backup script, including all necessary housekeeping actions, is included with our Docker Compose profiles. Refer to the appropriate documentation for detailed instructions [here](https://github.com/StrangeBeeCorp/docker).
    * You can also review the backup script for `prod1-thehive` directly on our GitHub repository.
