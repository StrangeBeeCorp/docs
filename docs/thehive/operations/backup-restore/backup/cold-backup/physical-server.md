# For Physical Servers
  
## Introduction

Unlike virtualized or containerized environments, physical servers require direct access to the file system and services to perform backups. This procedure focuses on cold backups, where services are stopped to ensure the integrity and consistency of the data, indices, and logs.

When performing a backup on physical servers, itâ€™s essential to:

1. Stop services (e.g., Elasticsearch, Cassandra, TheHive) to avoid data corruption.
2. Ensure file permissions are adequate for the backup process.
3. Use tools like rsync to copy data, configuration files, and logs to a designated backup location.
4. Validate the backup to ensure it can be restored without issues.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have direct access to the server via SSH or other administrative tools and sufficient disk space to store backups. By following this procedure, you can create a consistent backup that can be securely archived or transferred for disaster recovery purposes.

This process and example below assume you have followed our [step-by-step guide](../../../../installation/step-by-step-installation-guide.md) to install the application stack.

!!! Note
    Before proceeding, ensure you have read the general [Backup and Restore Overview](../../cold-hot-backup-restore.md) to understand the core principles of backup strategies.

## Step-by-step instructions

### Stop the services in this order

1. TheHive
2. Elasticsearch
3. Cassandra

!!! Example ""

    ```bash
    systemctl stop thehive
    systemctl stop elasticsearch
    systemctl stop cassandra
    ```

### Copy files in a backup folder

For example, create a folder on a dedicated NFS volume named `/opt/backups` and copy all files preserving their permissions

!!! Example ""

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    
    ## ============================================================
    ## BACKUP SCRIPT FOR THEHIVE APPLICATION STACK
    ## ============================================================
    ## PURPOSE:
    ## This script creates a backup of TheHive application stack, 
    ## including its configuration, data, and logs. It is designed 
    ## to ensure data is preserved for restoration purposes.
    ##
    ## IMPORTANT:
    ## - This script must be run with appropriate permissions to read all data 
    ##   and write to the backup folders.
    ## - Ensure sufficient storage is available in the backup location to avoid 
    ##   partial or failed backups.
    ## - Services (Elasticsearch, Cassandra, and TheHive) will be stopped during 
    ##   the backup process to ensure data integrity.
    ##
    ## DISCLAIMER:
    ## - Users are strongly advised to test this script in a non-production 
    ##   environment to ensure it works as expected with their specific 
    ##   infrastructure and application stack before using it in production.
    ## - The maintainers of this script are not responsible for any data loss, 
    ##   corruption, or issues arising from the use of this script during your 
    ##   backup or restore processes. Proceed at your own risk.
    ##
    ## USAGE:
    ## 1. Update the variables at the start of the script to reflect your setup:
    ##    - BACKUP_ROOT_FOLDER: Root folder where backups will be stored.
    ## 2. Run the script using the following command:
    ##    `bash ./scripts/backup.sh`
    ##
    ## ADDITIONAL RESOURCES:
    ## Refer to the official documentation for detailed instructions and 
    ## additional information: https://docs.strangebee.com/thehive/operations/backup-restore/backup/physical-server/
    ##
    ## WARNING:
    ## - This script stops Elasticsearch, Cassandra, and TheHive services, 
    ##   performs the backup, and then restarts the services.
    ## - Do not modify the rest of the script unless necessary.
    ##

    ## DO NOT MODIFY ANYTHING BELOW THIS LINE

### Start services in this order

1. Elasticsearch
2. Cassandra
3. TheHive

!!! Example ""

    ```bash
    systemctl start thehive
    systemctl start elasticsearch
    systemctl start cassandra
    ```

## Validation

check the backup folder and verify the data has been well copied.
