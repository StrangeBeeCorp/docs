# How to Create an Observable Type

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for creating an [observable](../../user-guides/analyst-corner/cases/observables/about-observables.md) type in TheHive.

Observable types define the different categories of observables that can be used within the application. TheHive includes a predefined set of types, and this list can be extended with custom types.
