# Configure MFA

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security technology that requires at least two authentication methods from different types of credentials to verify a user's identity for login to an application or other transaction.

Multi-factor authentication strengthens your account security significantly.

You can download any one of the following Multi-Factor Authentication apps:
iOS devices: Authy
Android devices: Authy
Windows devices: Microsoft Authenticator

To Configure MFA:

1. Submit a token using the **QR code** or the **Secret key** to validate MFA activation.
