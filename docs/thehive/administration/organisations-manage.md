## Locking an Organisation

If necessary, you can lock an existing organisation to prevent all users associated with it from logging in. This can be useful in situations where the organisation needs to be temporarily restricted or deactivated.

To lock an organisation, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Organisations** page.
2. Select the organisation you wish to lock.
