# About Organization

Organizations are the customers or tenants who are using the TheHive application.

TheHive comes with a default organization named "admin" and is dedicated to users with administrator permissions of TheHive instance. This organization is very specific so that it can manage global objects and cannot contain cases or any other related elements.

By default, organizations can’t see each other and can't share data. 

On the home page, you can see the organization List.
