    **Tasks sharing rule**

    How tasks linked to a case are handled when the case is shared with another organization.

    Pick an option from the dropdown list:

        - *autoShare*: Tasks are shared automatically.

    **Observables sharing rule**

    How observables linked to a case are handled when the case is shared with another organization.
