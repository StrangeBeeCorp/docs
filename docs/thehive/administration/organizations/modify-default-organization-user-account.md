# Modify the Default Organization for a User Account

<!-- md:permission `[admin] manageUser` -->

Set a new default organization for a user account in TheHive.

The default organization is the one the user is directed to when signing in to TheHive and the one used by default when accessing the [API](https://docs.strangebee.com/thehive/api-docs/), either directly or through an [alert feeder](../../user-guides/organization/configure-organization/manage-feeders/about-feeders.md).

<h2>Procedure</h2>

1. {% include-markdown "includes/users-view-go-to.md" %}

2. Locate the user account you're looking for, hover over it, and select :fontawesome-solid-eye:.

3. In the drawer, go to the **Organizations** section and hover over the organization you want to set as the default one.

4. Select **Set as default**.

5. Select **Confirm**.
