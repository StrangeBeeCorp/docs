# About Custom Fields

Custom fields are like custom properties that we can attach to cases and alerts. 

By default, in the TheHive platform, cases and alerts have pre-defined fields. If you need to add a new field to the alert or case, you can create a custom field.

You can view the custom fields list in the Custom Fields tab of the Entities Management page.
