# About Custom Fields

Custom fields let you add additional information to the predefined fields in [cases](../../user-guides/analyst-corner/cases/about-cases.md) and [alerts](../../user-guides/analyst-corner/alerts/about-alerts.md).

This topic provides a general overview of custom field usage in TheHive.

## Use cases

Custom fields are used to:

* Provide context to cases or alerts, such as the geographic location of an incident or its severity level
* Support organizational alignment by specifying the relevant business unit or team
* Enable integration with external tools by including identifiers, adding related data, or linking directly to external resources
* Streamline processes by indicating internal classification levels
* Manage checklists to validate specific steps when handling a case or alert
* Enhance data analysis through tagging, for example, identifying incidents involving VIPs

## Types

Custom fields support the following types:

{!includes/custom-fields-formats.md!}

## Permissions

{!includes/administrator-access-manage-custom-fields.md!}

After creation, custom fields are automatically available to all users across your organizations, allowing them to add the fields to cases and alerts. You can configure these fields to be either optional or mandatory for analysts to complete.
