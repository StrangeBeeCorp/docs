# About Custom Fields

Custom fields let you add additional information beyond the default fields in [cases](../../user-guides/analyst-corner/cases/about-cases.md) and [alerts](../../user-guides/analyst-corner/alerts/about-alerts.md).

This topic provides a general overview of custom field usage in TheHive.

## Use cases

In TheHive, custom fields are used to:

* Provide context to cases or alerts, such as the geographic location of an incident or its severity level
* Support organizational alignment by specifying the relevant business unit or team
* Enable integration with external tools by including identifiers, adding related data, or linking directly to external resources
* Streamline processes by indicating internal classification levels
* Manage checklists to validate specific steps when handling a case or alert
* Enhance data analysis through tagging, for example, identifying incidents involving VIPs

## Types

Custom fields support the following types:

## Expected values

The values you can enter in custom fields fall into two categories:

* Free text: Users can manually enter any value.
* Dropdown list: Users choose from predefined options.

## Completion rules

Custom fields can be either optional or mandatory. You must complete all mandatory custom fields before [closing a case](../../user-guides/analyst-corner/cases/close-a-case.md) or [an alert](../../user-guides/analyst-corner/alerts/close-an-alert.md).
