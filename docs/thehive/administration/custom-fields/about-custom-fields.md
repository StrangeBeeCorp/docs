# About Custom Fields

Custom fields let you add additional information to [cases](../../user-guides/analyst-corner/cases/about-a-case.md) and [alerts](../../user-guides/analyst-corner/alerts/about-alerts.md).

By default, TheHive includes predefined fields for cases and alerts. To better suit your needs, you can create custom fields to tailor cases and alerts. 

You can configure these fields as optional or mandatory for users.

## Use cases

You can use custom fields to:

* Provide context to cases or alerts, such as the geographic location of an incident or its severity level.
* Support organizational alignment by specifying the relevant business unit or team.
* Enable integration with tools and feeders by including identifiers or other data from external systems, or linking directly to external system data.
* Streamline processes by indicating internal classification levels.
* Manage checklists to validate specific steps when handling a case or alert.
* Enhance data analysis through tagging, for example, identifying incidents involving VIPs.

## Types

You can define custom fields in the following formats:

{!includes/custom-fields-formats.md!}

## Permissions

You must be an administrator to create custom fields in the **Entities management** view.

After creation, custom fields become automatically available to all users across all organizations.
