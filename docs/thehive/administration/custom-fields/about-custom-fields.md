# About Custom Fields

Custom fields let you add additional information to [cases](../../user-guides/analyst-corner/cases/about-cases.md) and [alerts](../../user-guides/analyst-corner/alerts/about-alerts.md).

By default, TheHive includes predefined fields for cases and alerts. To better suit your needs, you can create custom fields to tailor cases and alerts.

This topic provides a general overview of custom field usage in TheHive.

## Use cases

You can use custom fields to:

* Provide context to cases or alerts, such as the geographic location of an incident or its severity level
* Support organizational alignment by specifying the relevant business unit or team
* Enable integration with tools and feeders by including identifiers or other data from external systems, or linking directly to external system data
* Streamline processes by indicating internal classification levels
* Manage checklists to validate specific steps when handling a case or alert
* Enhance data analysis through tagging, for example, identifying incidents involving VIPs

## Types

You can define custom fields in the following formats:

{!includes/custom-fields-formats.md!}

## Permissions

{!includes/administrator-access-manage-custom-fields.md!}

After creation, custom fields are automatically available to all users across your organizations, allowing them to [add the fields](../../user-guides/analyst-corner/cases/cases-description/add-custom-fields.md) to cases and alerts. You can configure these fields to be either optional or mandatory for analysts to complete.
