# About Custom Fields

Custom fields let you add additional information to the predefined fields in [cases](../../user-guides/analyst-corner/cases/about-cases.md) and [alerts](../../user-guides/analyst-corner/alerts/about-alerts.md).

This topic provides a general overview of custom field usage in TheHive.

## Use cases

Custom fields are used to:

* Provide context to cases or alerts, such as the geographic location of an incident or its severity level
* Support organizational alignment by specifying the relevant business unit or team
* Enable integration with external tools by including identifiers, adding related data, or linking directly to external resources
* Streamline processes by indicating internal classification levels
* Manage checklists to validate specific steps when handling a case or alert
* Enhance data analysis through tagging, for example, identifying incidents involving VIPs
