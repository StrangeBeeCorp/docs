# About Custom Fields

Custom fields let you add additional information to cases or alerts. 

By default, TheHive provides predefined fields for cases and alerts. If you need to include additional information specific to your organization, you can create custom fields to tailor alerts and cases to your needs. These custom fields can be configured as either optional or mandatory for users.

## Use cases

Custom fields are typically used to:

* Provide context to cases or alerts, such as the geographic location of an incident or its severity level.
* Support organizational alignment by specifying the relevant business unit or team.
* Enable integration with tools and feeders by including identifiers or other data from external systems, or linking directly to external system data.
* Streamline processes by indicating internal classification levels.
* Manage checklists to ensure specific steps are validated when handling a case or alert.
* Enhance data analysis through tagging, for example, identifying incidents involving VIPs.

## Types

Custom fields can be configured in the following formats:

{!includes/custom-fields-formats.md!}

## Permissions

Administrators define custom fields in the **Entities management** view of TheHive.

After they are created, custom fields become automatically available to all users across all organizations.
