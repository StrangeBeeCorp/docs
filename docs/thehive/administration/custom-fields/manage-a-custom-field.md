# Manage Custom Fields

<!-- md:permission `[admin] manageCustomField` -->

Manage [custom fields](../custom-fields/about-custom-fields.md) in TheHive by setting them as mandatory or optional, defining predefined values, and organizing them into groups.

## Set a custom field as mandatory or optional

It is recommended to set a custom field as mandatory if it is used in dashboards or any automation workflow.

1. {% include-markdown "includes/entities-management-view-go-to.md" %}

2. {% include-markdown "includes/custom-fields-tab-go-to.md" %}

3. Select :fontawesome-solid-ellipsis: next to the custom field you want to edit.

4. Select **Edit**.

5. Turn the **Mandatory** toggle on or off.

6. Select **Confirm custom field edition**.

## Enter predefined values into a custom field

For the string, integer, and float types, you can define predefined values. If you choose to do this, users are only able to select from the predefined values you specify. This helps maintain data consistency for reporting purposes.

1. {% include-markdown "includes/entities-management-view-go-to.md" %}

2. {% include-markdown "includes/custom-fields-tab-go-to.md" %}

3. Select :fontawesome-solid-ellipsis: next to the custom field you want to edit.

4. Select **Edit**.

5. Enter each predefined value on a separate line in the **Options** field.

6. Select **Confirm custom field edition**.

## Assign multiple custom fields to the same group

1. {% include-markdown "includes/entities-management-view-go-to.md" %}

2. {% include-markdown "includes/custom-fields-tab-go-to.md" %}

3. Select :fontawesome-regular-square: next to the custom fields you want to edit.

4. Select :fontawesome-solid-pen:.

5. Enter the new group to apply.

6. Select **Confirm**.
