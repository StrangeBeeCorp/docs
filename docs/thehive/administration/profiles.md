## About Permissions

Each profile is defined by a set of permissions.
There are two profile types:

* Administration, used by users in the Admin organisation, to manage the platform
* Organization used in business organisations

Permissions are named `manageEntity` with `Entity`, an entity in the application. For example: `manageCase`. A permission `manageEntity` means having rights to write, update,delete an entity.

Except the *admin* profile, all profiles can be customised and deleted.
