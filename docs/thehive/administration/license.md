    The license is defined by the following capabilities:

    1. It defines how many users you can create in your platform
    2. The license is based on the number of users and the number of organisations
    3. It has a validation and an expiration date
    4. It allows unlimited number of *ReadOnly* users and *Service* accounts. Service accounts are those who do not have access to the TheHive interface but can use an API key to call all the APIs
