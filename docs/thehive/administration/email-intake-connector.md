# Email Intake Connector

This documentation outlines the utilization of the Email Intake Connector for automatically generating alerts from a designated mailbox.

The Email Intake Connector facilitates the connection of mailboxes used to receive cybersecurity alerts. It automatically transforms new emails into alerts within TheHive platform. Presently, the primary function supported is the creation of alerts regardless of the received email content.

### Adding a Mailbox

Configuration options are available for Microsoft 365 (OAuth2) and Google Workspace (OAuth2). If you use another email provider service, configuration through IMAP is necessary.

Additionally, provide your mailbox credentials. We recommend enabling SSL Check Certificate Authority.

### Settings

After testing your mailbox configuration, select the organisation to connect, determining where alerts will be created. Define the mailbox folder to monitor (typically INBOX). Finally, specify the action to take on incoming emails: ``archive``, ``mark as read``, or ``no action``.
