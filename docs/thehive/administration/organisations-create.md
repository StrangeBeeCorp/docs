## Adding a New Organisation

To add a new organisation, follow these steps:

1. Click on the :fontawesome-regular-square-plus: button located on the top left corner of the Organisations page. This action will open a drawer where you can enter the details for the new organisation.

2. Fill in the required fields in the drawer:

    - **Logo**: Add a placeholder logo or upload the logo of the organisation. This will help in visually identifying the organisation within the system.
    - **Name**: Enter the official name of the new organisation. This name will be used throughout the system to refer to this organisation.
    - **Description**: Provide a brief description of the organisation. This can include the purpose, mission, or any other relevant information about the organisation.
    - **Task Sharing Rule**: Define the default sharing rule for tasks. This rule will be applied whenever a case is shared with another organisation. It ensures that tasks are managed according to the predefined policies.
    - **Observables Sharing Rule**: Define the default sharing rule for observables. This rule will be applied whenever a case is shared with another organisation. It helps in maintaining consistent policies for sharing observables across organisations.

3. After filling in all the required information, click the **Confirm** button to create the organisation. The new organisation will now appear in the list of organisations on the Organisations page.
