# About Statuses

The status represents the current state of a case or alert.

This article explains how statuses works in TheHive.

## Attributes

Each status is associated with:

* A stage: TheHive includes three stagesâ€”*new*, *in progress*, and *closed*.
* A visibility: The status is either displayed or hidden.

## Permissions

After creation, statuses are available to users in cases and alerts.
