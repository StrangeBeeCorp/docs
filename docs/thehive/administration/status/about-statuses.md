# About Statuses

The status represents the current state of a case or alert.

This article explains how statuses works in TheHive.

## Attributes

Each status is associated with:

* A stage: TheHive includes three predefined stagesâ€”*New*, *In progress*, and *Closed*. Stages are hard-coded and can't be modified, deleted, or extended.
* A visibility: The status is either displayed or hidden (available since version 5.5).
* A color: The color should help users easily recognize the status.

## Permissions
