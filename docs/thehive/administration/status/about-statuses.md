# About Statuses

The status represents the current state of a case or alert.

This article explains how statuses works in TheHive.

## Attributes

Each status is associated with:

* A stage: TheHive includes three predefined stagesâ€”*New*, *In progress*, and *Closed*. Stages are hardcoded and can't be modified, deleted, or extended.
* A visibility: The status is either displayed or hidden.

## Permissions

After creation, statuses are available to users in cases and alerts.
