# How to Delete a Status

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for deleting a [status](about-statuses.md) for cases and alerts in TheHive.

!!! info "Deletion conditions"
    You can delete a status only if it isn't [a predefined status managed by TheHive](about-statuses.md#predefined-statuses) and isn't used in any case or alert. To check where a status is applied, [use filters and sorting in case and alert lists](../../user-guides/analyst-corner/about-filtering-and-sorting.md). You can hide a predefined status by [changing its visibility](change-visibility-of-a-status.md).
