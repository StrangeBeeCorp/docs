# How to Change a Status Visibility

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for changing a [status](about-statuses.md) visibility for cases and alerts in TheHive.

This is useful if you want to hide TheHiveâ€™s predefined statuses, so users only use the custom statuses you have created.

!!! info "Available since version 5.5"
    Starting with version 5.5, you can manage the visibility of a status.

{!includes/administrator-access-manage-statuses.md!}

## Procedure

1. {!includes/entities-management-view-go-to.md!}

2. {!includes/status-tab-go-to.md!}

3. Select :fontawesome-solid-ellipsis: next to the status you want to edit.

4. Select **Edit**.

5. In the **Add a custom status** drawer, enter the new visibility you want to apply.

    Specifies whether you want to display or hide a status in TheHive interface. If you hide a status that's already applied to existing cases or alerts, it remains applied until manually changed and is no longer available for selection.

6. Select **Confirm custom status creation**.
