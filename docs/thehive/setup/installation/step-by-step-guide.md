## :fontawesome-solid-database:  Apache Cassandra

Apache Cassandra is a scalable and high available database. TheHive supports the latest stable version **4.0.x** of Cassandra.

!!! Info "Upgrading from Cassandra 3.x"
    If you are upgrading from Cassandra 3.x, please follow the [dedicated guide](./upgrade-from-4.x.md). This part is relevant for fresh installation only.

### Installation

=== "DEB"
    
    1. Add Apache repository references

        ```bash
        wget -qO -  https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/KEYS | sudo gpg --dearmor  -o /usr/share/keyrings/cassandra-archive.gpg
        echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cassandra-archive.gpg] https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/debian 40x main" |  sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cassandra.sources.list 
        ```

    2. Install the package

        ```bash
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install cassandra
        ```

=== "RPM"

    1. Add Cassandra repository keys

        ```bash
        rpm --import https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/KEYS
        ```

    2. Add the Apache repository for Cassandra to `/etc/yum.repos.d/cassandra.repo`

        ```bash title="/etc/yum.repos.d/cassandra.repo"
        [cassandra]
        name=Apache Cassandra
        baseurl=https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/redhat/40x/
        gpgcheck=1
        repo_gpgcheck=1
        gpgkey=https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/KEYS
        ```

    3. Install the package

        ```bash
        sudo yum install cassandra
        ```

=== "Other"

    Download and untgz archive from http://cassandra.apache.org/download/ in the folder of your choice.


By default, data is stored in `/var/lib/cassandra`.


### Configuration

Configure Cassandra by editing `/etc/cassandra/cassandra.yaml` file.


```yaml title="/etc/cassandra/cassandra.yaml"
# content from /etc/cassandra/cassandra.yaml
[..]
cluster_name: 'thp'
listen_address: 'xx.xx.xx.xx' # address for nodes
rpc_address: 'xx.xx.xx.xx' # address for clients
seed_provider:
    - class_name: org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleSeedProvider
      parameters:
          # Ex: "<ip1>,<ip2>,<ip3>"
          - seeds: 'xx.xx.xx.xx' # self for the first node
data_file_directories:
  - '/var/lib/cassandra/data'
commitlog_directory: '/var/lib/cassandra/commitlog'
saved_caches_directory: '/var/lib/cassandra/saved_caches'
hints_directory: 
  - '/var/lib/cassandra/hints'
[..]
```

### Start the service 

=== "DEB"

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start cassandra
    ```

    !!! Tip "Remove existing data before starting"
        With the DEB packages, Cassandra service could start automatically before configuring it: 
        Stop it, remove the data and restart once the configuration is updated: 
        ```bash
        sudo systemctl stop cassandra
        sudo rm -rf /var/lib/cassandra/*
        ```

=== "RPM"

    Run the service and ensure it restart after a reboot:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo service cassandra start
    sudo systemctl enable cassandra
    ```

By default Cassandra listens on `7000/tcp` (inter-node), `9042/tcp` (client).

## :fontawesome-solid-list: Elasticsearch

TheHive requires Elasticsearch to manage data indices. 

!!! Info "Elasticsearch 7.x only is supported"

### Installation

=== "DEB"
    
    1. Add Elasticsearch repository keys

        ```bash
        wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch |  sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/elasticsearch-keyring.gpg
        sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
        ```

    2. Add the DEB repository of Elasticsearch 

        ```bash
        echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/elasticsearch-keyring.gpg] https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/apt stable main" |  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-7.x.list 
        ```

    3. Install the package

        ```bash
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install elasticsearch
        ```


=== "RPM"

    1. Add Elasticsearch repository references

        ```bash
        rpm --import https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
        ```

    2. Add the RPM repository of Elasticsearch to `/etc/yum.repos.d/elasticsearch.repo`

        ```bash title="/etc/yum.repos.d/elasticsearch.repo"
        [elasticsearch]
        name=Elasticsearch repository for 7.x packages
        baseurl=https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/yum
        gpgcheck=1
        gpgkey=https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
        enabled=0
        autorefresh=1
        type=rpm-md
        ```

    3. Install the package

        ```bash
        sudo yum install --enablerepo=elasticsearch elasticsearch
        ```
    
    !!! Note "References"
        - [https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/rpm.html ](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/rpm.html)

=== "Other"

    Download and untgz archive from http://cassandra.apache.org/download/ in the folder of your choice.


### Configuration 

- `/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml`

Elasticsearch configuration should contain the following lines: 

```yaml title="/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml"
http.host: 127.0.0.1
transport.host: 127.0.0.1
cluster.name: hive
thread_pool.search.queue_size: 100000
path.logs: "/var/log/elasticsearch"
path.data: "/var/lib/elasticsearch"
xpack.security.enabled: false
script.allowed_types: "inline,stored"
```

!!! Note
    - Indexes will be created at the first start of TheHive. It can take few time
    - Like data and files, indexes should be part of the backup policy
    - Indexes can removed and created again


- Custom JVM options
add the file `/etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options.d/jvm.options` with following lines:

```
-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true
-Xms4g
-Xmx4g
```

!!! Note "This can be updated according the amount of memory available"

### Sart the service

=== "DEB"

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start elasticsearch
    ```

    !!! Tip "Remove existing data before starting"
        With the DEB packages, Elastic service could start automatically before configuring it: 
        Stop it, remove the data and restart once the configuration is updated: 
        ```bash
        sudo systemctl stop elasticsearch
        sudo rm -rf /var/lib/elasticsearch/*
        ```

=== "RPM"

    Run the service and ensure it restart after a reboot:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo service elasticsearch start
    sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch
    ```


## :fontawesome-solid-folder-tree: File storage
For standalone production and test servers, we recommends using local filesystem. If you think about building a cluster with TheHive, you have several possible solutions: using NFS or S3 services; see the [related guide](./3-node-cluster.md) for more details and an example with MinIO servers.  

=== "Local Filesystem"
    To store files on the local filesystem, start by choosing the dedicated folder (by default `/opt/thp/thehive/files`):

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /opt/thp/thehive/files
    ```

    This path will be used in the configuration of TheHive.

    Later, after having installed TheHive, ensure the user `thehive` owns the path chosen for storing files:

    ```bash
    chown -R thehive:thehive /opt/thp/thehive/files
    ```

=== "S3 with Min.io"

    An example of installing, configuring and use Min.IO is detailed in [this documentation](./3-node-cluster.md).



## :material-beehive-outline: TheHive

This part contains instructions to install TheHive and then configure it.


### Installation

All packages are published on our packages repository. We support Debian and RPM packages as well as binary packages (zip archive). All packages are signed using our GPG key [562CBC1C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheHive-Project/TheHive/master/PGP-PUBLIC-KEY). Its fingerprint is `0CD5 AC59 DE5C 5A8E 0EE1  3849 3D99 BB18 562C BC1C`.

=== "DEB"
    ```bash
    wget -O- https://archives.strangebee.com/keys/strangebee.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/strangebee-archive-keyring.gpg
    ```

=== "RPM"
    ```bash
    sudo rpm --import https://archives.strangebee.com/keys/strangebee.gpg 
    ```


Install TheHive package by using the following commands:


=== "DEB"

    ```bash
    echo 'deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/strangebee-archive-keyring.gpg] https://deb.strangebee.com thehive-5.x main' | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/strangebee.list
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y thehive
    ```

=== "RPM"
    1. Setup your system to connect the RPM repository. Create and edit the file `/etc/yum.repos.d/strangebee.repo`:

        ```bash title="/etc/yum.repos.d/strangebee.repo"
        [thehive]
        enabled=1
        priority=1
        name=StrangeBee RPM repository
        baseurl=https://rpm.strangebee.com/thehive-5.x/noarch
        gpgkey=https://archives.strangebee.com/keys/strangebee.gpg
        gpgcheck=1
        ```

    2. Then install the package using `yum`:

        ```bash
        sudo yum install thehive
        ```

=== "Other"
    1. Download and unzip the chosen binary package. TheHive files can be installed wherever you want on the filesystem. In this guide, we assume you have chosen to install them under `/opt`.

        ```bash
        cd /opt
        wget https://archives.strangebee.com/keys/thehive-latest.zip
        unzip thehive-latest.zip
        sudo ln -s thehive-x.x.x thehive
        ```

    2. Prepare the system. It is recommended to use a dedicated, non-privileged user account to start TheHive. If so, make sure that the chosen account can create log files in `/opt/thehive/logs`.

        ```bash
        sudo addgroup thehive
        sudo adduser --system thehive
        sudo chown -R thehive:thehive /opt/thehive
        sudo mkdir /etc/thehive
        sudo touch /etc/thehive/application.conf
        sudo chown root:thehive /etc/thehive
        sudo chgrp thehive /etc/thehive/application.conf
        sudo chmod 640 /etc/thehive/application.conf
        ```

    3. Copy the systemd script in `/etc/systemd/system/thehive.service`.

        ```bash
        cd /tmp
        wget https://github.com/TheHive-Project/TheHive/blob/master/package/thehive.service
        sudo cp thehive.service /etc/systemd/system/thehive.service
        ```



### Configuration

The configuration that comes with binary packages is ready for a standalone installation, everything on the same server. 

In this context, and at this stage, you might need to set the following parameters accordingly:

```yaml title="/etc/thehive/application.conf"
[..]
# Service configuration
application.baseUrl = "http://localhost:9000" # (1)
play.http.context = "/"                       # (2)
[..]
```

1. :fontawesome-solid-laptop: specify the scheme, hostname and port used to join the application
2. :fontawesome-brands-safari: specify if you use a custom path (`/` by default)


Following configurations are required to start TheHive successfully:

- Secret key configuration
- Database configuration
- File storage configuration

#### Secret key configuration

=== "Debian"
    The secret key is automatically generated and stored in `/etc/thehive/secret.conf` by package installation script.

=== "RPM"
    The secret key is automatically generated and stored in `/etc/thehive/secret.conf` by package installation script.

=== "Other"
    Setup a secret key in the `/etc/thehive/secret.conf` file by running the following command:

    ```bash
    cat > /etc/thehive/secret.conf << _EOF_
    play.http.secret.key="$(cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 64 | head -n 1)"
    _EOF_
    ```

#### Database & index
By default, TheHive is configured to connect to Cassandra and Elasticsearch databases installed locally.


```yaml title="/etc/thehive/application.conf"
# Database and index configuration
# By default, TheHive is configured to connect to local Cassandra 4.x and a
# local Elasticsearch services without authentication.
db.janusgraph {
  storage {
    backend = cql
    hostname = ["127.0.0.1"]
    # Cassandra authentication (if configured)
    # username = "thehive"
    # password = "password"
    cql {
      cluster-name = thp
      keyspace = thehive
    }
  }
  index.search {
    backend = elasticsearch
    hostname = ["127.0.0.1"]
    index-name = thehive
  }
}
```

#### File storage

By default, TheHive is configured to store files locally in `/opt/thp/thehive/files`.

=== "Local filesystem"

    If you chose to store files on the local filesystem:

    1. Ensure thehive user has permissions on the destination folder

        ```bash
        chown -R thehive:thehive /opt/thp/thehive/files
        ```

    2. Default values in the configuration file 

        ```yaml title="/etc/thehive/application.conf"
        # Attachment storage configuration
        # By default, TheHive is configured to store files locally in the folder.
        # The path can be updated and should belong to the user/group running thehive service. (by default: thehive:thehive)
        storage {
        provider = localfs
        localfs.location = /opt/thp/thehive/files
        }
        ```

=== "S3"
    If you chose MinIO and a S3 object storage system to store files in a filesystem, add following lines to TheHive configuration file (`/etc/thehive/application.conf`)

    ```yaml title="/etc/thehive/application.conf"
    ## Storage configuration
    storage {
        provider: s3
        s3 {
        bucket = "thehive"
        readTimeout = 1 minute
        writeTimeout = 1 minute
        chunkSize = 1 MB
        endpoint = "http://<IP_ADDRESS>:9100"
        accessKey = "<MINIO ACCESS KEY>"
        secretKey = "<MINIO SECRET KEY>"
        region = "us-east-1"
        }
    }
    alpakka.s3.path-style-access = force
    ```

### Run

```bash
sudo systemctl start thehive
sudo systemctl enable thehive
```

!!! Info "Please consider the service may take a while at the first start"

Once it has started, open your browser and connect to `http://YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS:9000/`.

The default admin user is `admin@thehive.local` with password `secret`. It is recommended to change the default password.

## Advanced configuration
