=== "Other Installation Methods"


    Download the tar.gz archive from [**Apache Cassandra Downloads**](http://cassandra.apache.org/download/) and extract it into the folder of your choice. You can use utilities like `wget` to download the archive.


By default, data is stored in `/var/lib/cassandra`. Ensure appropriate permissions are set for this directory to avoid any issues with data storage and access.

&nbsp;

### Configuration

You can configure Cassandra by modifying settings within the `/etc/cassandra/cassandra.yaml` file.


**1.Locate the Cassandra Configuration File:**
   
   Navigate to the directory containing the Cassandra configuration file `/etc/cassandra/`.

**2.Edit the `cassandra.yaml` File:**
   
   Open the `cassandra.yaml` file in a text editor with appropriate permissions.

**3.Configure Cluster Name:**
   
   Set the `cluster_name` parameter to the desired name. This name helps identify the Cassandra cluster.

**4.Configure Listen Address:**
   
   Set the `listen_address` parameter to the IP address of the node within the cluster. This address is used by other nodes within the cluster to communicate.

**5.Configure RPC Address:**
   
   Set the `rpc_address` parameter to the IP address of the node to enable clients to connect to the Cassandra cluster.

**6.Configure Seed Provider:**
   
   Ensure the `seed_provider` section is properly configured. The `seeds` parameter should contain the IP address(es) of the seed node(s) in the cluster.

**7.Configure Directories:**
   
   Set the directories for data storage, commit logs, saved caches, and hints as per your requirements. Ensure that the specified directories exist and have appropriate permissions.

**8.Save the Changes:**
   
   After making the necessary configurations, save the changes to the `cassandra.yaml` file.


!!! Example ""
    ```yaml title="/etc/cassandra/cassandra.yaml"
    # content from /etc/cassandra/cassandra.yaml
    [..]
    cluster_name: 'thp'
    listen_address: 'xx.xx.xx.xx' # address for nodes
    rpc_address: 'xx.xx.xx.xx' # address for clients
    seed_provider:
        - class_name: org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleSeedProvider
        parameters:
            # Ex: "<ip1>,<ip2>,<ip3>"
            - seeds: 'xx.xx.xx.xx' # self for the first node
    data_file_directories:
    - '/var/lib/cassandra/data'
    commitlog_directory: '/var/lib/cassandra/commitlog'
    saved_caches_directory: '/var/lib/cassandra/saved_caches'
    hints_directory: 
    - '/var/lib/cassandra/hints'
    [..]
    ```

&nbsp;

### Start the service 

=== "DEB"
    
    1. Start the Service

        - *Execute the following command to start the Cassandra service:*
        
        !!! Example ""
            ```bash
            sudo systemctl start cassandra
            ```

    2. Ensure Service Restarts After Reboot:

        - *Enable the Cassandra service to restart automatically after a system reboot:*

        !!! Example ""
            ```bash
            sudo systemctl enable cassandra
            ```

    3. (Optional) Remove Existing Data Before Starting

        - *If the Cassandra service was started automatically before configuring it, it's recommended to stop it, remove existing data, and restart it once the configuration is updated. Execute the following commands:*

        !!! Example ""
            ```bash
            sudo systemctl stop cassandra
            sudo rm -rf /var/lib/cassandra/*
            ```

=== "RPM"

    1. Start the Service

        - *Start the Cassandra service by running:*
        
        !!! Example ""
            ```bash
            sudo systemctl daemon-reload
            sudo service cassandra start
            ```

    2. Ensure Service Restarts After Reboot

        - *Enable the Cassandra service to restart automatically after a system reboot:*

        !!! Example ""
            ```bash
            sudo systemctl enable cassandra
            ```

!!! Note "Note"
    Cassandra defaults to listening on port 7000/tcp for inter-node communication and port 9042/tcp for client communication.


<!-- #### Additional configuration : disable tombstones  (for standalone server **ONLY**)

!!! Warning "This action should be performed after the installation and the first start of TheHive"

If you are installing a standalone server, tombstones can be disabled. 

1. Check `gc_grace_seconds` value

    !!! Example ""        
        ```bash
        cqlsh -u cassandra <IP ADDRESS> -e "SELECT table_name,gc_grace_seconds FROM system_schema.tables WHERE keyspace_name='thehive'"
        ```

        **Note**: default credentials for Cassandra database: _cassandra/cassandra_ 

    Results should look like this: 

    ```output
                table_name       | gc_grace_seconds
        -------------------------+------------------
                    edgestore    |           864000
                edgestore_lock_  |           864000
                    graphindex   |           864000
                graphindex_lock_ |           864000
                janusgraph_ids   |           864000
            system_properties    |           864000
        system_properties_lock_  |           864000
                    systemlog    |           864000
                        txlog    |           864000
    ```


2. Disable by setting `gc_grace_seconds` to 0. Use this command line: 

    !!! Example ""       
        ```bash
        for TABLE in edgestore edgestore_lock_ graphindex graphindex_lock_ janusgraph_ids system_properties system_properties_lock_ systemlog txlog
            do
            cqlsh -u cassandra -e "ALTER TABLE thehive.${TABLE} WITH gc_grace_seconds = 0;"
            done
        ```

3. Check changes has been taken into account, by running this command again: 

    !!! Example ""        
        ```bash
        cqlsh -u cassandra <IP ADDRESS> -e "SELECT table_name,gc_grace_seconds FROM system_schema.tables WHERE keyspace_name='thehive'"
        ``` 

    Results should look like this: 

    ```output
                table_name       | gc_grace_seconds
        -------------------------+------------------
                    edgestore    |           0
                edgestore_lock_  |           0
                    graphindex   |           0
                graphindex_lock_ |           0
                janusgraph_ids   |           0
            system_properties    |           0
        system_properties_lock_  |           0
                    systemlog    |           0
                        txlog    |           0
    ```

## :fontawesome-solid-folder-tree: File Storage
For standalone production and test servers, we recommend using the local filesystem. However, if you are considering building a cluster with TheHive, there are several possible solutions available, including NFS or S3 services. For further details and an example involving MinIO servers, please refer to the [**related guide**](./deploying-a-cluster.md).

=== "Local Filesystem"
    To utilize the local filesystem for file storage, begin by selecting a dedicated folder. By default, this folder is located at `/opt/thp/thehive/files`:

    !!! Example ""
        ```bash
        sudo mkdir -p /opt/thp/thehive/files
        ```

    This path will be utilized in the configuration of TheHive. After installing TheHive, it's important to ensure that the user thehive owns the chosen path for storing files:

    !!! Example ""
        ```bash
        chown -R thehive:thehive /opt/thp/thehive/files
        ```

=== "S3 with Min.io"

    Detailed documentation on the installation, configuration, and usage of Min.IO can be found in [this documentation](./deploying-a-cluster.md).

## :material-beehive-outline: TheHive Installation and Configuration

This section provides detailed instructions for installing and configuring TheHive.

&nbsp;

### Installation

All required packages are available on our package repository. We support Debian and RPM packages, as well as binary packages in zip format. All packages are signed using our GPG key [**562CBC1C**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheHive-Project/TheHive/master/PGP-PUBLIC-KEY) with the fingerprint `0CD5 AC59 DE5C 5A8E 0EE1 3849 3D99 BB18 562C BC1C`.

=== "DEB"

    For Debian systems, use the following commands:

    !!! Example ""
        ```bash
        wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StrangeBeeCorp/Security/main/PGP%20keys/packages.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/strangebee-archive-keyring.gpg
        ```
    
=== "RPM"

    For RPM-based systems, follow these steps:

    !!! Example ""
        ```bash
        sudo rpm --import https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StrangeBeeCorp/Security/main/PGP%20keys/packages.key
        ```


Install TheHive package by using the following commands:


=== "DEB"

    !!! Example ""
        ```bash
        echo 'deb [arch=all signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/strangebee-archive-keyring.gpg] https://deb.strangebee.com thehive-5.3 main' |sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/strangebee.list
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y thehive
        ```

=== "RPM"

    1. Import the RPM repository key:

        !!! Example ""
            ```bash
            sudo rpm --import https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StrangeBeeCorp/Security/main/PGP%20keys/packages.key
            ```

    2. Create and edit the file /etc/yum.repos.d/strangebee.repo:

        !!! Example ""
            ```bash title="/etc/yum.repos.d/strangebee.repo"
            [thehive]
            enabled=1
            priority=1
            name=StrangeBee RPM repository
            baseurl=https://rpm.strangebee.com/thehive-5.3/noarch
            gpgkey=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StrangeBeeCorp/Security/main/PGP%20keys/packages.key
            gpgcheck=1
            ```

    3. Then install the package using `yum`:

        !!! Example ""
            ```bash
            sudo yum install thehive
            ```

=== "Other Installation Methods"

    If you prefer a binary package, follow these steps:


    1. Download and unzip the chosen binary package. TheHive files can be installed wherever you want on the filesystem. In this guide, we assume you have chosen to install them under `/opt`.

        !!! Example ""
            ```bash
            cd /opt
            wget https://archives.strangebee.com/zip/thehive-latest.zip
            unzip thehive-latest.zip
            sudo ln -s thehive-x.x.x thehive
            ```

    2. Prepare the system. It is recommended to use a dedicated, non-privileged user account to start TheHive. If so, make sure that the chosen account can create log files in `/opt/thehive/logs`.

        !!! Example ""
            ```bash
            sudo addgroup thehive
            sudo adduser --system thehive
            sudo chown -R thehive:thehive /opt/thehive
            sudo mkdir /etc/thehive
            sudo touch /etc/thehive/application.conf
            sudo chown root:thehive /etc/thehive
            sudo chgrp thehive /etc/thehive/application.conf
            sudo chmod 640 /etc/thehive/application.conf
            ```

    3. Copy the systemd script in `/etc/systemd/system/thehive.service`.

        !!! Example ""
            ```bash
            cd /tmp
            wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheHive-Project/TheHive/master/package/thehive.service
            sudo cp thehive.service /etc/systemd/system/thehive.service
            ```

&nbsp;

### Configuration

The setup provided with binary packages is tailored for a standalone installation, with all components hosted on the same server. At this point, it's crucial to fine-tune the following parameters as necessary:

!!! Example ""
    ```yaml title="/etc/thehive/application.conf"
    [..]
    # Service configuration
    application.baseUrl = "http://localhost:9000" # (1)
    play.http.context = "/"                       # (2)
    [..]
    ```

    1. :fontawesome-solid-laptop: Define the scheme, hostname, and port for accessing the application
    2. :fontawesome-brands-safari: Indicate if a custom path is being used (default is /)


The following configurations are necessary for successful initiation of TheHive:

- Secret key configuration
- Database configuration
- File storage configuration

&nbsp;

#### Secret key configuration

=== "DEB"
    The secret key is automatically generated and stored in `/etc/thehive/secret.conf` during package installation.

=== "RPM"
    The secret key is automatically generated and stored in `/etc/thehive/secret.conf` during package installation.

=== "Other"
    To set up a secret key, execute the following command:

    !!! Example ""
        ```bash
        cat > /etc/thehive/secret.conf << _EOF_
        play.http.secret.key="$(cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 64 | head -n 1)"
        _EOF_
        ```

#### Database & index
By default, TheHive is configured to connect to local Cassandra and Elasticsearch databases.

!!! Example ""
    ```yaml title="/etc/thehive/application.conf"
    # Database and index configuration
    # By default, TheHive is configured to connect to local Cassandra 4.x and a
    # local Elasticsearch services without authentication.
    db.janusgraph {
    storage {
        backend = cql
        hostname = ["127.0.0.1"]
        # Cassandra authentication (if configured)
        # username = "thehive"
        # password = "password"
        cql {
        cluster-name = thp
        keyspace = thehive
        }
    }
    index.search {
        backend = elasticsearch
        hostname = ["127.0.0.1"]
        index-name = thehive
    }
    }
    ```

#### File storage

The default file storage location of TheHive is `/opt/thp/thehive/files`.

=== "Local filesystem"

    If you decide to store files on the local filesystem:

    1. Ensure thehive user has permissions on the destination folder:

        !!! Example ""
            ```bash
            chown -R thehive:thehive /opt/thp/thehive/files
            ```

    2. Default values in the configuration file 

        !!! Example ""
            ```yaml title="/etc/thehive/application.conf"
            # Attachment storage configuration
            # By default, TheHive is configured to store files locally in the folder.
            # The path can be updated and should belong to the user/group running thehive service. (by default: thehive:thehive)
            storage {
            provider = localfs
            localfs.location = /opt/thp/thehive/files
            }
            ```

=== "S3"
    If you opt for MinIO and an S3 object storage system to store files in a filesystem, append the following lines to TheHive configuration file (/etc/thehive/application.conf):

    !!! Example ""
        ```yaml title="/etc/thehive/application.conf"
        ## Storage configuration
        storage {
            provider: s3
            s3 {
            bucket = "thehive"
            readTimeout = 1 minute
            writeTimeout = 1 minute
            chunkSize = 1 MB
            endpoint = "http://<IP_ADDRESS>:9100"
            accessKey = "<MINIO ACCESS KEY>"
            secretKey = "<MINIO SECRET KEY>"
            region = "us-east-1"
            }
        }
        alpakka.s3.path-style-access = force
        ```

#### Cortex & MISP

The initial configuration file packaged with the software contains the following lines, which enable the Cortex and MISP modules by default. If you're not utilizing either of these modules, you can simply comment out the corresponding line and restart the service.

!!! Example ""
    ```yaml title="/etc/thehive/application.conf"
    # Additional modules
    #
    # TheHive is strongly integrated with Cortex and MISP.
    # Both modules are enabled by default. If not used, each one can be disabled by
    # ommenting the configuration line.
    scalligraph.modules += org.thp.thehive.connector.cortex.CortexModule
    scalligraph.modules += org.thp.thehive.connector.misp.MispModule
    ```

&nbsp;

### Run

To start TheHive service and enable it to run on system boot, execute the following commands in your terminal:

!!! Example ""
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start thehive
    sudo systemctl enable thehive
    ```

!!! Info "Please be aware that the service may take some time to start initially."

After the service has successfully started, launch your web browser and navigate to `http://YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS:9000/`

The default admin user credentials are as follows:

!!! Note ""
    ```bash
    Username: admin@thehive.local
    Password: secret
    ```

For security reasons, it is strongly advised to change the default password after logging in.
