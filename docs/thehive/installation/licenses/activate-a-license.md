# How to Activate a License

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for activating a [TheHive license](about-licenses.md), whether itâ€™s a Community, Gold, or Platinum license.

!!! note "TheHive On-prem only"
    License activation is required only for TheHive On-prem users. TheHive Cloud Platform users aren't affected because the Platinum license is activated automatically

!!! tip "Platinum trial"
    <!-- md:version 5.3 --> Installing TheHive On-prem includes a 14-day Platinum trial license. After this trial period, TheHive transitions to read-only mode, requiring a valid license for all users for continued full functionality.

!!! warning "Requirements"

    * For Community license: This procedure assumes that you have already obtained a Community license by following the [Request a Community License](request-a-community-license.md) topic
    * For Gold and Platinum licenses: This procedure assumes that you have already [purchased a valid Gold or Platinum license](https://strangebee.com/try-thehive/) and no longer wish or are able to use your trial license.
