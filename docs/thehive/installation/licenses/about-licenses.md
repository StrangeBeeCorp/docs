TheHive provides different types of licenses to meet the needs of various teams. It includes a **free Community License**, which offers essential features. For more advanced needs, there are two paid options: the **Gold License** and the **Platinum License**.

- **Gold License**: The Gold License is designed for internal response teams who benefit from enhanced case management lifecycles and integration within their organizational infrastructure.

- **Platinum License**: The Platinum License is best suited for large teams needing extensive server connections, clustering, and dedicated, continuous support for mission-critical, large-scale incident response operations.
 
With version 5.3 and later, TheHive is provided with a 14-day **Platinum trial**, which supports up to 2 organizations and 5 users. After this trial period, TheHive transitions to read-only mode, requiring a valid license for continued full functionality. All users are required to generate a valid license on StrangeBee's portal to use the platform.

!!! Note
    A free *Community license* with essential features is available. Paid licenses providing access to advanced features are also available, by [contacting us](https://strangebee.com/contact-strangebee/){target=_blank}.

    If you are already using TheHive 5.x Community version, please create your account on the License Portal before upgrading to version 5.3 or later. Without this Community License, your interface will be limited to read-only mode.
