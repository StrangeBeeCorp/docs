# How to Request a Community License

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for requesting a [TheHive Community license](about-licenses.md).

The Community license is free and includes essential features to help you get started with TheHive or support basic user needs.

!!! note "TheHive On-prem only"
    The Community license is available exclusively for TheHive On-prem deployments and isn't offered for TheHive Cloud Platform.

!!! warning "Upgrading with Community license"
    If youâ€™re upgrading to TheHive version 5.3 or later from a TheHive 5.x Community edition, you must complete this procedure to avoid having your interface limited to read-only mode.

<h2>Procedure</h2>
