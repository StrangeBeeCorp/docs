# Activating Paid License

## Overview

In addition to the [Community License](./request-community-license.md), The Hive provides two advanced licensing options tailored to meet various operational requirements.

### Gold License
The Gold License is designed for internal response teams who benefit from enhanced case management lifecycles and integration within their organizational infrastructure.

### Platinum License
The Platinum License is best suited for large teams needing extensive server connections, clustering, and dedicated, continuous support for mission-critical, large-scale incident response operations.

For full details, refer to [The Hive Pricing](https://strangebee.com/thehive-pricing-on-prem/).
