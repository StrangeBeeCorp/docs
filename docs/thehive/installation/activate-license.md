# Activating TheHive License

With version 5.3 and later, TheHive is provided with a 14-day **Platinum trial**, which supports up to 2 organizations and 5 users. After this trial period, TheHive transitions to read-only mode, requiring a valid license for continued full functionality. All users are required to generate a valid license on StrangeBee's portal to use the platform.

A free *Community license* with essential features is available. Paid licenses providing access to advanced features are also available, by [contacting us](https://strangebee.com/contact-strangebee/){target=_blank}.

!!! Note
    If you are already using TheHive 5.x Community version, please create your account on the License Portal before upgrading to version 5.3 or later. Without this Community License, your interface will be limited to read-only mode.
