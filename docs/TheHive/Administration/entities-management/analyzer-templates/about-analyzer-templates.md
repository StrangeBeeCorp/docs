# About Analyzer Templates

Analyzers templates are angular js code used to display a human-readable report of an analyzer job report.

In TheHive, you can add observables. They are technical elements that can be analyzed using analyzers. Analyzers will take the technical element as input and produce a JSON formatted report as output.

This JSON report may not be human-friendly when looking for information into this report, and this report can be very long. 

While analysts use these analyzers to get accurate information in a timely manner, we provide analyzers-template to format this JSON report and provide something more human-readable or put the most accurate information on the top of the list/more visible for the analysts.

This analyzers-template can be added, modified, or deleted in TheHive for each existing analyzer.
