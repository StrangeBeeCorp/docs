# Configure LDAP Server

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is an open standard application protocol to access and maintain distributed directory information services over an IP network. 

LDAP is a request-response type of protocol where each request is followed by a response.

Directory services allow information about users, systems, networks, services, and applications to be shared throughout the network.

In this section you will find information about configuring the LDAP server.

In order to use LDAP to assign a group policy to a user, you must map an LDAP attribute.

To configure the LDAP server:

1. On the Platform Management page, in the LDAP tab, click the **+** button or click the **Add LDAP server** link.
