# About Endpoints

Global endpoints are endpoints of type Webhook, Mattermost, Slack, or HTTP. These endpoints can be used by every organization. 
TheHive can notify external system or third party tool of the modification events (case creation, alert update, task assignment).

For example, every time you create a case in TheHIve, create a ticket in JIRA.
