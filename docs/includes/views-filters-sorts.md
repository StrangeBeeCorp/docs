!!! tip "Saving views"
    If you frequently use filters, consider saving your preferences as [views](/thehive/user-guides/analyst-corner/about-views/) for easy reuse.

For more information on filtering and sorting, refer to the [About Filtering and Sorting](/thehive/user-guides/analyst-corner/about-filtering-and-sorting/) topic.

<!-- md:version 5.5.4 --> A beta feature is available to test a new UI for filters and views, designed to improve usability and enhance the user experience. Currently, this feature applies only to lists of cases, alerts, tasks, and observables. For detailed instructions on how to activate this beta feature, see [Activate the Beta of Filters and Views](/thehive/user-guides/analyst-corner/manage-user-settings#activate-the-beta-of-filters-and-views/).
