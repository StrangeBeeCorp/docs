!!! tip "Best practices for safe backup and restore"
    * Always test the backup and restore process in a non-production or test environment before applying it to a live system to ensure the process works as expected.
    * Ensure you have an up-to-date backup before starting the restore operation, as errors during the restoration could lead to data loss.
