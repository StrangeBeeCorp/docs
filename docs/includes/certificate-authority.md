Add a certificate authority.

    For more information about configuring SSL, refer to the [Configure SSL](/thehive/administration/authentication/ssl/) topic.

    Use certificates only from trusted, predefined authorities for secure connections. Custom certificate authorities are not allowed.

    You can turn off the **Don't check certificate authority** toggle to bypass certificate validation, but this isn't recommended as it may compromise connection security.
