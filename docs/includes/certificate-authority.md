Add a certificate authority.

    For more information about configuring SSL, refer to the [Configure SSL](ssl.md) topic.

    Only use certificates from trusted, predefined authorities for secure connections; you can't use custom certificate authorities.

    You can turn off the **Don't check certificate authority** toggle to bypass certificate validation, but this isn't recommended as it may compromise connection security.
