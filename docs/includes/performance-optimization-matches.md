    !!! info "Performance optimization"
        To optimize performance, a maximum of 100 observables are displayed in the **Matches** drawer. Users with an admin-type profile can adjust this limit in the `application.conf` file. However, increasing it beyond 100 may impact application performance. Proceed with caution when modifying this setting, as performance can't be guaranteed if the limit is raised.
