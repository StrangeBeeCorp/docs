!!! tip " Wildcard character"
    You can use the wildcard character *\** to broaden your searches.

    The wildcard character acts as a placeholder that matches zero or more characters, helping you find variations of a term or incomplete information.
    
    Examples of use cases:

    * Email domains: Entering *\*@gmail.com* returns entities containing the gmail.com domain.
    * IP subnets: Entering *192.168.\*.\** returns entities with IP addresses in the 192.168.x.x subnet.
    * URLs: Entering *https://malwaredomain.com/\** returns entities hosted under the malwaredomain.com directory.

    Other advanced search options, such as Boolean and phrase searches, aren't currently supported.
