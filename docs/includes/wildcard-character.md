!!! tip "<!-- md:version 5.4.7 --> Wildcard character"
    You can use the wildcard character *\** to broaden your searches.

    The wildcard character acts as a placeholder that matches zero or more characters, helping you find variations of a term or incomplete information.
    
    Examples of use cases:

    * Email domains: Entering *\*@gmail.com* will return entities containing the gmail.com domain.
    * IP subnets: Entering *192.168.\*.\** will return entities with IP addresses in the 192.168.x.x subnet.
    * URLs: Entering *https://malwaredomain.com/\** will return entities hosted under the malwaredomain.com directory.

    Other advanced search options, such as Boolean and phrase searches, are not currently supported.
