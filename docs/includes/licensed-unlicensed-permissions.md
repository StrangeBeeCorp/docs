!!! info "Licensed vs. unlicensed permissions"
    Permissions are divided into two categories to help you identify which ones require a paid [license](/thehive/installation/licenses/about-licenses/). If a profile includes at least one licensed permission, it is marked as license required when [assigning a user to an organization](/thehive/administration/organizations/add-remove-an-existing-user-account-from-an-organization/).
