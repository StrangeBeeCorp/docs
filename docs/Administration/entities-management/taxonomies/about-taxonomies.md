# About Taxonomies

The TheHive application introduces the support of Taxonomies as it is defined and published by MISP. These set of classification libraries can be used in THeHive to tag Cases, Observables and Alerts.

Taxonomies are likes groups or catalogues or custom packs. You can import the list of taxonomies and use them to classify the cases and alerts using the pre-defined tags from the taxonomies. You can enable the taxonomies you want to use.

> By default, TheHive does not contain any taxonomy.

You can view the list of all imported taxonomies  on the Entities Management page, in the Taxonomies tab.
