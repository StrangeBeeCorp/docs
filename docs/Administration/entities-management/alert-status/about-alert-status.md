# About Alert Status

By default, the TheHive application comes with a list of pre-defined alert statuses. An alert status describes the status of an alert where the stage value is New, InProgress, Closed, or imported. 

You can also customize the labels of the alert statuses.

e.g., You can customize the InProgress status as "Under Investigation" or "Pending Customer Reply" value, depending on your requirement.

You can see the list of all alert statuses on the Entities Management page, in the alert Status tab.
