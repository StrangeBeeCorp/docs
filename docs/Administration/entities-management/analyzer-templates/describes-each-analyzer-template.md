# Describe Each Analyzer Template

There are two types of analyzers templates:

* Long template: The one you will see when opening the analysis report on an observable page
* Short template: Small tag that will be added to an observable. You can see them on the observables page.

Long template example:

The following is a "raw" report. It is an analyzer report that hasn't been formatted by an analyzer template.

The same report after formatted by the "long" analyzer-template is:

Short template example:

These are short reports, providing a very concise summary of the analysis report.
