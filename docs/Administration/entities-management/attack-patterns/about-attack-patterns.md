# About Attack Patterns


MITRE ATT&CK is an organization that describes the behaviors that attackers can use to make a security attack. They classify those behaviors on tactics, and within each tactic, they define many techniques. These techniques are the cells in the MITRE ATT&CK matrix. 

ATT&CK, which stands for Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge, can help you understand how cyber attackers think and work.

The matrix allows you to give an overview of how the attacker did the attack, by which phases they went through.

In TheHIve application, you can import all the catalogs of the MITRE ATT&CK matrix and attach the attack patterns to your incidence.

you can view all the attack patterns on the Entities Management page, in the Attack Patterns tab.
