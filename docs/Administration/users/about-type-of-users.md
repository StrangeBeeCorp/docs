# About Type of Users

In TheHive, a user is a member of one or more organisations. One user has a profile for each organisation and can have different profiles for different organisations. 

For example:

* “analyst” in “organisationA”
* “admin” in “organisationB”
* “read-only” in “organisationC”

> NOTE: A single user can belong to many organizations and in each organization it has a   dedicated user profile.
