# Deploy Cortex on Kubernetes

Deploy Cortex on a Kubernetes cluster using [the StrangeBee Helm chart repository](https://github.com/StrangeBeeCorp/helm-charts){target=_blank}.

!!! danger "Dependency image"
    The default Elasticsearch image used by the dependency Helm chart comes from [Bitnami](https://bitnami.com/){target=_blank}.  

    Following [Bitnami decision to stop maintaining multiple freely available image versions](https://news.broadcom.com/app-dev/broadcom-introduces-bitnami-secure-images-for-production-ready-containerized-applications){target=_blank}, StrangeBee Helm charts now reference the `bitnamilegacy` repository for Elasticsearch. Bitnami latest public images ship Elasticsearch 9, which isn't compatible with Cortex.

    This has important consequences:

    * This legacy image won't receive security updates and will become increasingly vulnerable over time. You may continue to use it at your own risk, but it isn't production-ready.
    * You can pay Bitnami for access to updated images and configure the Helm chart to reference them.
    * Alternatively, you can deactivate the dependency Helm charts and bring your own Elasticsearch deployment.

## Architecture overview

The default deployment includes:

* Cortex application pods
* A two-node Elasticsearch cluster for search indexing
* Shared storage for analyzer job data

## Infrastructure requirements

* Kubernetes cluster v1.23.0 or later
* Helm v3.8.0 or later
* Minimum resources per node: see [Cortex Installation System Requirements](../installation-and-configuration/index.md#hardware-requirements)
* StorageClass supporting `ReadWriteMany` access mode
* Network policies allowing inter-pod communication

## Step 1: Ensure all users can access files on the shared filesystem

!!! warning "Configuration errors"
    Improperly configured shared filesystems can cause errors when running jobs with Cortex.

!!! info "Why a shared filesystem"
    When running on Kubernetes, Cortex launches a new pod for each analyzer or responder execution. After the job completes and Cortex retrieves the result, the pod is terminated. Without a shared filesystem accessible by both the Cortex pod and these analyzer and responder pods, they can't access the data they need to operate, causing the jobs to fail.

    Kubernetes supports several methods for sharing filesystems between pods, including:

    * [PV using an NFS server](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#nfs){target=_blank}
    * Dedicated storage solutions like [Longhorn](https://longhorn.io/){target=_blank} or [Rook](https://rook.io/){target=_blank}

    This guide focuses on configuring a PV using an NFS server, with an example for [AWS Elastic File System (EFS)](#example-deploy-cortex-using-aws-efs).

At runtime, Cortex and its jobs run on different pods and may use different user IDs (UIDs) and group IDs (GIDs):

* Cortex defaults to uid:gid `1001:1001`.
* Analyzers may use different uid:gid, such as `1000:1000` or `0:0` if running as root.

To prevent permission errors when reading or writing files on the shared filesystem, [configure the NFS server](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/man5/exports.5.html){target=_blank} with the `all_squash` parameter. This ensures all filesystem operations use uid:gid `65534:65534`, regardless of the user's actual UID and GID.

## Step 2: Deploy Cortex

### Deploy with default configuration

!!! info "Service account"
    A service account (SA) allows a pod to authenticate and interact with the Kubernetes API, enabling it to perform specific actions within the cluster. When deploying Cortex, a dedicated SA is essential for creating and managing Kubernetes jobs that run analyzers and responders. Without proper configuration, Cortex can't execute these jobs.

!!! note "Using an existing PV"
    The `cortex` Helm Chart can operate without creating a new PV, provided that an existing PV—created by the cluster administrator—matches the PVC configuration specified in the Helm Chart.

Use the `cortex` Helm chart to automate the creation of the PV, PVC, and SA during deployment. 

The default configuration is designed for development environments and requires modifications for production use. See [Production configuration](#production-configuration) for required adjustments.

1. Add the StrangeBee Helm repository

    ```bash
    helm repo add strangebee https://strangebeecorp.github.io/helm-charts
    ```

2. Update your local Helm repositories

    ```bash
    helm repo update
    ```

3. Create a release using the `cortex` Helm chart

    ```bash
    helm install <release_name> strangebee/cortex
    ```

!!! warning "First start"
    At first start, you must access the Cortex web page to update the Elasticsearch database.

For more options, see [the Helm documentation for installation](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install/){target=_blank}.

!!! info "Dependency"
    The `cortex` Helm chart relies on the [Bitnami Elasticsearch Stack](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/elasticsearch){target=_blank} by default as the search index.

!!! note "Upgrades"
    To upgrade your release to the latest version of the `cortex` Helm chart, run:
    ```bash
    helm upgrade <release_name> strangebee/cortex
    ```
    For additional options and best practices, see [the Helm upgrade documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade/){target=_blank}.

### Production configuration

The default `cortex` Helm chart bundles all dependencies for quick deployment but uses development-oriented configurations. Production deployments require adjustments to Cortex and its dependencies for security, performance, and reliability.

Use the following command to view all available configuration options for the `cortex` Helm chart:

```bash
helm show values strangebee/cortex
```

For more information on customization, see [the dedicated Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#customizing-the-chart-before-installing){target=_blank}. You can also review the available options for the dependency.

#### Storage configuration

!!! warning "Shared storage requirement"
    Cortex requires a shared PVC with `ReadWriteMany` access mode to allow multiple pods to read and write data simultaneously—essential for job inputs and outputs.

By default, this chart attempts to create such a PVC using your cluster’s default StorageClass. Ensure this StorageClass supports `ReadWriteMany` to avoid deployment issues or target a StorageClass in your cluster compatible with this access mode.

Common solutions include:

* Running an NFS server reachable from your cluster and creating a PV targeting it
* Using dedicated storage solutions like [Longhorn](https://longhorn.io/){target=_blank} or [Rook](https://rook.io/){target=_blank}
* Leveraging cloud provider-specific solutions like [AWS EFS with the EFS CSI Driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-efs-csi-driver){target=_blank}

Also note that Cortex stores data in Elasticsearch. Regular backups are strongly recommended to prevent data loss, especially when deploying Elasticsearch on Kubernetes using the [Bitnami Elasticsearch Stack](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/elasticsearch){target=_blank}.

#### Elasticsearch

By default, this chart deploys an Elasticsearch cluster with two nodes, both master-eligible and general-purpose.

You can review the [Bitnami Elasticsearch Helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/elasticsearch){target=_blank} for available configuration options.

!!! note "Same Elasticsearch instance for both TheHive and Cortex"
    Using the same Elasticsearch instance for both TheHive and Cortex isn't recommended. If this setup is necessary, ensure proper connectivity and configuration for both pods and use Elasticsearch version 7.x. Be aware that sharing an Elasticsearch instance creates an interdependency that may lead to issues during updates or downtime.

#### Cortex server in TheHive

See [Add a Cortex Server](../../thehive/administration/cortex/add-a-cortex-server.md) for detailed instructions.

When TheHive and Cortex deploy in the same Kubernetes cluster, use the Cortex service DNS as the server URL.

```bash
http://cortex.<namespace>.svc:9001
```

### Example: Deploy Cortex using AWS EFS

#### Prerequisites

Before setting up the PV for AWS EFS, complete the following steps:

* [Create an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/efs-csi.html) to allow the EFS CSI driver to interact with EFS.
* Install the EFS CSI driver on your Kubernetes cluster using one of the following methods:
    * [EKS add-ons](https://www.eksworkshop.com/docs/fundamentals/storage/efs/efs-csi-driver){target=_blank} (recommended)
    * [Official Helm chart](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-efs-csi-driver/releases?q=helm-chart&expanded=true){target=_blank}
* [Create an EFS filesystem](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-efs-csi-driver/blob/master/docs/efs-create-filesystem.md){target=_blank} and note the associated EFS filesystem ID.

#### 1. Create a StorageClass for EFS

!!! note "Reference example"
    The following manifests are based on the [EFS CSI driver multiple pods example](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-efs-csi-driver/tree/master/examples/kubernetes/multiple_pods){target=_blank}.

Create a StorageClass that references your EFS filesystem:    

```yaml
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: efs-sc
provisioner: efs.csi.aws.com
# https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-efs-csi-driver?tab=readme-ov-file#storage-class-parameters-for-dynamic-provisioning
parameters:
  provisioningMode: efs-ap # EFS access point provisioning mode
  fileSystemId: fs-01234567 # Replace with your EFS filesystem ID
  directoryPerms: "700" # Permissions for newly created directories
  uid: 1001 # User ID to set file permissions
  gid: 1001 # Group ID to set file permissions
  ensureUniqueDirectory: "false" # Set to false to allow shared folder access between Cortex and job containers
  subPathPattern: "${.PVC.namespace}/${.PVC.name}" # Optional subfolder structure inside the NFS filesystem
```

#### 2. Create a PVC using the EFS StorageClass

Kubernetes automatically creates a PV when defining a PVC with the EFS StorageClass.

Use the `cortex` Helm chart to configure the storageClass value in the chart settings. This ensures the PVC is created automatically during deployment. To do so, open the [`values.yaml`](https://github.com/StrangeBeeCorp/helm-charts/blob/main/cortex-charts/cortex/values.yaml){target=_blank} file and look for the `persistentVolumeClaim` section.
