# Dashboards

In this section you can find information about dashboards.

A dashboard is a visual display of data to provide information at-a-glance. The dashboard is configurable, allowing you to choose which data you want to see and whether you want to include charts or graphs to visualize the numbers.

The dashboard lists all details of cases such as, status, name, version number, widget, created by, dates of creation and date on which data was updated. A user can apply filters on the dashboard, sort based on fields, and manage views.
